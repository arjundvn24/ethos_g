Taylor Swift,Emily Ratajkowski curses Ellen DeGeneres after Taylor Swift interview...,"Ellen DeGeneres finds herself, once again, under fire for her treatment of a celebrity guest on her now- canceled daytime show.
Emily Ratajkowski slammed the TV megastar on Friday for humiliating Taylor Swift, 33, when her career was getting underway.
“This is so f–ked up. She’s literally begging her to stop,” the 31-year-old model states in the comments section of a video that went viral this week on TikTok.
The Post reached out to a rep for DeGeneres, 64, for comment.
The TikToker stitched two clips of Swift together. One is her 2019 interview with Zane Lowe and the other is her 2012 appearance on DeGeneres’ show. The user seems to imply that Swift was dissing her experience on DeGeneres’ show during her discussion with Lowe, although Swift doesn’t name names.
“This is so f–ked up. She’s literally begging her to stop,” Ratajkowski commented on a viral video of the decade-old interview. Getty Images
In the Lowe segment, Swift alludes to an old interview that made her feel uncomfortable when she was 23, saying that people at the time were “reducing” her to who she dated, “making slideshows of my dating life and putting people in there that I had sat next to at a party once.”
They were “deciding that my songwriting was a trick, rather than a skill and a craft,” she said candidly to Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1.
“It’s a way to take a woman who is doing her job and succeeding at doing her job and making things, and in a way, it’s figuring out how to completely minimize that skill,” Swift continued.

In the 2012 clip, DeGeneres torments the singer with a slideshow of photos of Swift with an array of different men. From Taylor Lautner to Justin Bieber, DeGeneres prods the “All Too Well” crooner to dish which guy she sings about on her album.
“I don’t want to,” she pleads when DeGeneres asks her to ring a bell when a muse’s photo appears on screen. “They’ll send me angry emails, and I don’t want to get them.”

Swift, although young at the time, wasn’t afraid to push back.
“Stop it, stop it, stop!” the singer exclaims as DeGeneres sits in the chair opposite, grinning. “This makes me feel so bad about myself. Every time I come up here, you put a different dude up there on the screen, and it just makes me really question what I stand for as a human being.”

Under the TikTok clip, which has garnered 1.5 million views, viewers lit up the comments section, expressing their dismay and disgust for the longtime talk show host.
“Unbelievable,” wrote popular content creator Tinx.
“You can literally hear in her voice how upset she is,” one user argued.
“She’s clearly visibly upset, but having to, like, ‘perform’ that she’s laughing it off because an audience of people is laughing at her,” one person stressed.
“Taylor saying, ‘I don’t want to do it,’ should have been enough for Ellen to stop,” someone else proclaimed.
“Ellen has some real sketch interviews,” someone else noted.
DeGeneres, who has apologized for “toxic” workplace allegations from former staffers, has been called out for interviews some say missed the mark.
In 2008, the host outed Mariah Carey’s secret pregnancy when the pop singer pretended to take a sip of champagne. Later, following her miscarriage, Carey told Vulture she was “uncomfortable” at the time.
In another instance, Dakota Johnson took a swipe at the host when DeGeneres wrongly accused the “50 Shades of Grey” actress of not inviting her to a birthday bash.
“Actually, no, that’s not the truth, Ellen,” Johnson stated on air.
DeGeneres’ show ended in May 2022 after 19 seasons.
The multihyphenate returned to the spotlight last month to express sorrow over the death of her on-air DJ, Stephen “tWitch” Boss, who died by suicide at the age of 40.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/taylor-swift-comp-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,2023-01-08 17:16:27+00:00,@brookenkato,"Ellen DeGeneres finds herself, once again, under fire for her treatment of a celebrity guest on her now-canceled daytime show.

Taylor Swift,"No, SZA Doesn’t ‘Have Beef’ With Taylor Swift","SZA actually ""loved her album and the writing,"" so stans stop starting sh*t

On “Kill Bill,” SZA sings about wanting to kill her ex, not Taylor Swift. Get it right, stans! SZA clarified that she and the Midnights singer aren’t fighting after stans conflated the two artists promoting their music with the two women fighting.

After thanking her fans for “copping” digital versions of some of her SOS songs, SZA told her fans to stop coming for Swifties.

“Uhh I feel silly that I even have to say this but I see supporters arguing and I hate that,” SZA tweeted. “I don’t have beef w ANYONE especially not Taylor lmao.”

Complimenting Swift’s LP Midnights , SZA wrote, “I genuinely loved her album and the writing! Everyone’s jus tryna do their BEST as we all should. LOVE TO EVERYONE.”

Uhh I feel silly that I even have to say this but i see supporters arguing and I hate that . I don’t have beef w ANYONE especially not Taylor lmao I genuinely loved her album and the writing!Everyone’s jus tryna do their BEST as we all should . LOVE TO EVERYONE. Gn 🤍 — SZA (@sza) January 6, 2023

SZA’s clarification came after an unfounded back-and-forth between SZA Camp and Swifties as both artists released digital versions of some of their respective album’s songs to boost sales and reach the coveted No. 1 slot on the Billboard 200. (SOS currently sits at No. 1.)

To beat out SOS, Swift shared four different “ Midnights digital albums” that featured “behind the song” bonus material. Meanwhile, SZA dropped digital albums with different cover art, and additional solo versions of songs “PSA” and “Open Arms.”

Rolling Stone recently sat down with SZA to speak about her LP SOS and how it showed that though she’s “a kind person, I’m not a nice person.”

“I think this album was partially inspired by love lost, but mostly inspired by my departure from attempting to be a nice girl,” she said. “I’ve tried to be a nice girl for so long and it’s just not who I am, inherently.”

She added, “I think coming to terms with that and really expanding upon that and exploring that is kind of like this new chapter in my life.”",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sza-taylor.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2023-01-06 21:30:24+00:00,Tomás Mier,"SZA actually ""loved her album and the writing,"" so stans stop starting sh*t 				 	On “Kill Bill,” SZA sings about wanting to kill her ex, not Taylor Swift.

Taylor Swift,SZA Just Shut Down Rumors That She's Feuding With Taylor Swift Amid Their Battle For The Top Of The Charts,"SZA is speaking out about the rumors that she's feuding with Taylor Swift — and she's shutting things down.

Since the release of SZA's album SOS back in December, SOS and Taylor's album Midnights have been battling for the top of the charts.

While Taylor has sat atop charts like Billboard's Artist 100 and Top Album Sales, SZA has held the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks.

This past week in particular, SZA made a major push to rule all of the charts, releasing a $5 version of her album featuring new verses.

But amid the competition for the top of the charts, fans have pitted SZA and Taylor against each other — leading some to believe that there's beef between them.

SZA took to Twitter to shut down the rumors, explaining that there's absolutely no bad blood between them.

""Uhh I feel silly that I even have to say this but i see supporters arguing and I hate that,"" SZA wrote.

Uhh I feel silly that I even have to say this but i see supporters arguing and I hate that . I don’t have beef w ANYONE especially not Taylor lmao I genuinely loved her album and the writing!Everyone’s jus tryna do their BEST as we all should . LOVE TO EVERYONE. Gn 🤍

She continued, ""I don’t have beef w ANYONE especially not Taylor lmao I genuinely loved her album and the writing!""

SZA added that ""everyone’s jus tryna do their BEST"" and sent her love ""to everyone.""

Now that SZA has cleared the air, it's nice to know that these two superstars are supporting each other!

SZA is hitting ""Snooze"" on rumors that she has anything but love for Taylor Swift.

Both artists' respective latest albums — SZA's SOS and Swift's Midnights — have the potential to nab the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart this week. But it's not a competition, the ""Shirt"" singer-songwriter ensured fans via Twitter on Thursday.

In a tweet posted at 11:59 p.m., SZA thanked fans for supporting her new record, emphasizing that there was only""1 minute left in the tracking"" period for this week's charts.
""thank you for STREAMING SOS And copping [digital versions],"" wrote the 33-year-old performer. ""Thank you CAMP for always DOING YOUR BIG ONE [...] LOVE TO EVERYONE 🤍""

After the tweet was posted, several Swifties criticized SZA with allegations that she was looking to outperform Midnights. ""and if taylor tweeted something like this, y'all losers will call her chart obsessed,"" read one Twitter user's post amid a flurry of back-and-forth arguments from many fans discussing which they think deserves the No. 1 slot.

Less than 30 minutes after SZA's initial tweet was sent, she posted another, clarifying that she has nothing against Swift, 33, or her music.
""Uhh I feel silly that I even have to say this but i see supporters arguing and I hate that,"" wrote the Grammy winner.""I don't have beef w ANYONE especially not Taylor lmao""

She continued, ""I genuinely loved her album and the writing!Everyone's jus tryna do their BEST as we all should . LOVE TO EVERYONE. Gn 🤍""

In an interview with the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast last month, the ""Good Days"" singer opened up about how she felt watching SOS top the musical charts — and make her Spotify's No. 1 artist globally.
""I never thought in a million years that people would like it,"" SZA (whose real name is Solána Imani Rowe) told the outlet at the time. ""My dad's visiting right now, with my mom. Everybody came down to make sure I didn't lose my mind if the album went bad once it came out.
