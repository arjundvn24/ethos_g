But there had been a time when the English actress had been rejecting roles and movie offers like switching the channels on a television. While the said roles would more often than not get delivered to her on a silver platter, The Circle star still refused to work on various popular projects.Although she gained immense fame after starring as Hermoine Granger in the live adaptation of the fantasy book series, the 32-year-old actress had backed away from a number of roles that had been offered to her after Harry Potter.Related: Best Movies of Emma Watson According To LetterboxdEmma Watson‘s career in the film industry kickstarted with Harry Potter at the innocent age of 9, and as she grew up, the actress gradually slipped into the glimmering slippers of fame. Unlike many child/teenage actors whose popularity often ends up dying down, Watson only earned more and more recognition with time.Related: ‘Prisoner of Azkaban’ Director Asked Harry Potter Trio To Write an Essay on Their Character – Emma Watson Wrote 16 Pages, Daniel Radcliffe Had a 1 Page Summary, Rupert Grint Didn’t Write OneThroughout her career in Hollywood, Watson has joined forces with revered directors like Darren Aronofsky and led famous movies like Little Women. At the same time, however, there have also been plenty of films that the Beauty and the Beast actress has shot down with little or no hesitation. Damien Chazelle’s Oscar-winning La La Land is just one example; Watson was reportedly approached first for the musical romance but because she’d refused to work in it, the role went to Emma Stone instead.But the Colonia actress hadn’t been declining movies just for the heck of it or out of arrogance. The major reason why she wanted to take a step down from the realms of fame was because she had been adamant about finishing her education, which is why she went back to college in 2009.The same year that she was crowned the highest-grossing actress of the decade by the Guinness Book of World Records, Watson attended Brown University and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in English Literature from the Ivy League institution.While fans were shocked to see the Regression actress sidestep her career for college, she knew it was the wisest decision she could’ve made. In an old interview with Vanity Fair, Watson admitted that film agents and producers often reprimanded her for turning down critically hailed projects. But she wasn’t keen on getting popular at the cost of sacrificing her mental health and education.Related: “Everyone knows he used to be a stripper”: Emma Watson Couldn’t Handle Seeing Channing Tatum in a Thong in ‘This is the End’, Reportedly Walked Out of Set in Disgust“There have been hard moments in my career when I’ve had an agent or a movie producer say, ‘You are making a big mistake. But what’s the point of achieving great success if you feel like you’re losing your freakin’ mind? I’ve had to say, ‘Guys, I need to go back to school,’ or ‘I just need to go home and hang out with my cats.’ People have looked at me and been like, ‘Is she insane?’ But, actually, it’s the opposite of insane.”However, attending university wasn’t the only reason why she turned down high-end studio projects.  The Noah star had also revealed how she enjoyed working on relatively smaller projects rather than the mainstream big-budget movies. Stephen Chbosky-helmed The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) and Sofia Coppola’s The Bling Ring (2013) are just a few examples of the same.But even though Watson chose her education over her career, she’s still a monumental success in the film industry, and that speaks volumes.Source: Vanity Fairceleb newsEmma Watsonhollywood moviesAn author at FandomWire, an abnormal psychology student, and an avid reader of dark fiction, I love to read and write and have been indulging in the same for years.Want more stuff like this?Get the best viral stories straight into your inbox!\n\n\n\nDon't worry, we don't spam© FandomWire, LLC.

She remains curious, compassionate, and open-minded. And that's the kind of woman I would want to embody as a role model, given the choice,\" Watson said of her preference to star in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. (via) The actress revealed she watched a lot of Disney movies growing up.But what was the offer she turned down? Well, Emma Watson was offered the lead role in Damien Chazelle's romantic musical comedy-drama La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and another Emma – Stone. The film won 6 Oscars and grossed an impressive 447 million worldwide – 10 times its budget.While starring in the 2017 remake of Beauty and the Beast may have been Watson's dream, the reviews of her performance were rather disappointing. Some of the cruelest comments described her as giving one of the weaker performances of the cast.Cinephiles shared their impressions in a thread on Reddit that is honestly painful to read for any Watson fan.One of the commenters was particularly ruthless, saying that the Hermione actress was neither a beauty – just average – nor a good singer. Her acting was weak, stale, forced and stiff. The fact that she refused to wear a corset, driven by her own agenda, was bad for the movie, because what else can be the most beautiful classic Disney dress?And the bottom line is that Anne Hathaway should have played Belle. What a verdict! Some said the only part she's good at is Hermione because that's who she is in real life.One commenter went so far as to say, \"The one thing the Beauty and the Beast remake did really well was remind fans how lucky they are that Emma Watson and Miles Teller were replaced by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in La La Land.\"It should be noted, however, that for all the criticism directed at Watson in particular, Beauty and the Beast did quite well. Within ten days of its opening, it became the highest grossing live-action musical of all time, surpassing Mamma Mia! at the box office. In total, it grossed over 1.2 billion internationally.Whatever happens next, we love Henry anyway.","topImage":"https://startefacts.com/upload//upload/news/138546855658.jpg","date":"","author":"","description":"Harry Potter star Emma Watson once turned down an offer that could have made her even more famous, but she does not regret her decision because it helped her fulfill one of her childhood dreams.\r\n","keywords":[""],"_id":"63b46df33d9f429bc90fc6d4","__v":0},{"keyword":"Emma Watson","title":"Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint Couldn't Go Home After Being Cast in 'Harry Potter'","text":"Showbiz Cheat SheetBinge-worthy entertainment news and celebrity interviewsFor Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint, being cast in the Harry Potter movies was akin to winning the lottery. Thousands of other children were competing for a chance to portray Hermione Granger, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley. However, Grint, Radcliffe, and Watson managed to book the highly-competitive parts and cement their status as the golden trio.Of course, being cast in the Harry Potter movies was not a cakewalk for the actors. In fact, all three of them had to go through multiple rounds of auditions before they were offered their roles. And each of them had their fair share of obstacles along the way. Radcliffe, for example, initially wasn’t allowed to audition for the part. Since the movies were originally supposed to film in Los Angeles, his parents felt they would be too disruptive to his life. However, when the terms of the filming contract changed, they relented. Talent was likely a huge part of why Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson were the ones chosen for the main cast of the Harry Potter movies.  However, the actors’ tenacity likely helped too. Grint wrote an entire rap to help him stand out in his second audition tape after his first one went unnoticed. Meanwhile, Watson spent hours recording her audition, making sure she could get it perfect. Eventually, that determination paid off, and the young actors were told that they’d booked their roles.Of course, being cast in the Harry Potter movies was just the beginning for Watson, Grint, and Radcliffe. The films would launch the three actors into global superstardom. In fact, the media was invested in the trio right away. While speaking with W Magazine, Watson got candid about the media storm that surrounded her and her fellow castmates immediately. Things were so crazy, that the trio couldn’t even return to their homes after the news broke that they’d been cast as the films’ leads.“Within about half an hour, they’d taken a photograph of Dan, Rupert, and I, which was then broadcast on the Internet that the three of us had been cast,” Watson remembered. “We moved straight into a hotel. There were press outside our house. It was like this crazy whirlwind, like something from a movie.”That day was particularly hectic for Watson, who was the youngest of the trio. For months, she’d been waiting on bated breath for news about whether or not she’d gotten the part of Hermione. However, when she was finally told she’d earned a place in the Harry Potter cast, she had no idea what was happening because of the terminology that was used.\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEmma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, & Rupert Grint Didn’t Hang Out When They Weren’t Filming ‘Harry Potter’\t\t\n\t“They called me into the producer David Heyman’s very pristine white office and he said, ‘We just wanted to tell you that you are the preferred candidate for the role of Hermoine.’ And I kept thinking, ‘What does preferred candidate mean?'” Watson shared. Eventually, Watson would come to understand what was happening and learn that she’d booked a role in the Harry Potter movies. And while it was a dream come true for her, it also must have been an overwhelming day for the actor.","topImage":"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Emma-Watson-Daniel-Radcliffe-and-Rupert-Grint.jpg?w=1200","date":"2022-12-31T20:51:00+00:00","author":"Abeni Tinubu","description":"Being cast in the 'Harry Potter' movies would drastically change Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint's lives.","keywords":[""],"_id":"63b46df83d9f429bc90fc6d6","__v":0},{"keyword":"Emma Watson","title":"10 Best Cameos Where They Play Themselves, from Keanu Reeves to Emma Watson","text":"These actors have range.The art of the cameo has become an effective tool in modern filmmaking, often resulting in some of the most memorable moments in a movie. Whether it is a famous actor randomly passing by or an offscreen character that reveals themselves as a familiar face, cameos get people talking. Marvel has made a habit of it, always including the late Stan Lee in their movies while also featuring cameos from heroes and random celebrities.RELATED: 10 Sitcom Cameos That You Completely Forgot AboutWhile it is always great seeing a famous actor in a surprise appearance, sometimes the most memorable cameos are when the stars play themselves. These appearances are often at their own expense, playing an unlikable version of themselves or being dragged into some dangerous scheme. It is always lovely to see an actor not taking themselves too seriously, and the below ten are some of the best instances.Everyone loves Keanu Reeves, so it seems perfect to include him as a rival in a romantic comedy. Always Be My Maybe stars Ali Wong as Sasha, a celebrity chef who returns to her hometown to open a new restaurant. There she reunites with her childhood crush, Marcus (Randall Park) and their complicated relationship reignites.One of the best scenes in is when Sasha agrees to a double date with Marcus and his girlfriend, with Sasha's date being none other than Reeves. Mr. Wick plays an eccentric version of himself, spouting nonsense as if he is a spiritual guru, and the fact that Reeves is willing to poke fun at himself makes him even more endearing. Always Be My Maybe is available to stream on Netflix.Stan Lee is the undisputed champion of cameos, appearing in countless Marvel movies, so much so that one of the highlights of going to see a new MCU was waiting to see where he would pop up next. While his role in Mallrats is larger than his Marvel appearances, it is still a minor part that does not occur until near the end.The film sees Jason Lee and Jeremy London starring as two slackers who spend their days at the mall while pining for their ex-girlfriends. While there, Brodie (Lee) encounters the comic book legend, and he offers the teenager some profound advice about love, showcasing a genuinely touching performance from the great man.Another comedy from Kevin Smith, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back follows the two characters after their stint in Mallrats as they head to Hollywood to stop a movie that is being made about them. The film is filled with celebrity cameos, as stars such as Carrie Fisher, Chris Rock, and Mark Hamill all make appearances.One of the most memorable moments is when Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are seen on a studio set. Filming a sequel to their classic movie Good Will Hunting, dubbed 'Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season', the pair parody their previous film's dialogue before Damon whips out a shotgun and blows his rival away. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is available to stream on Showtime.Before his legendary turn as Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother, Neil Patrick Harris endeared himself to modern audiences through his appearances in the Harold & Kumar series. The first movie sees stoners Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) embark on a wild journey to White Castle in order to satisfy their munchies.The best friends encounter Harris, who at the time was best known for his role in Doogie Howser, M.D. The former child actor is nothing like they imagined as he takes drugs, steals their car, and uses it to have sex with prostitutes. His outrageous behavior helps Harold & Kumar earn its place as one of the best stoner movies. Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is available to stream on HBO Max.Coming from the minds behind Key & Peele, Keanu stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as a pair of best friends who lose their beloved kitten, Keanu. Discovering the kitten has been adopted by a dangerous gang leader, the friends pose as notorious assassins, so they can infiltrate his gang and take their kitten back.Anna Faris has made a name for herself by placing wacky characters, and Keanu sees her at her craziest. Playing a heightened version of herself, Faris engages in a drug deal with Rell (Peele) and Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish). A coked-up Faris offers to pay Hi-C to shoot Rell, so she can see what his brains look like.One of the most popular cartoons of the 21st century, SpongeBob SquarePants is beloved by fans worldwide. The movie follows SpongeBob and Patrick as they embark on a journey to clear Mr. Krabs's name after he is accused of stealing King Neptune's crown. Of course, the pair find themselves in constant trouble.Towards the end of the film, once SpongeBob and Patrick retrieve the crown, they find themselves lost. Who else would appear and offer them a ride than David Hasselhoff? The pair hop on The Hoff and ride him across the ocean, even engaging in a fight with the film's big bad across the Baywatch star's bare back. The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is available to stream on Paramount+.One of Adam Sandler's best movies, Happy Gilmore sees the funnyman playing the titular failed hockey player who tries his hand at golf. Discovering that his beloved grandmother is going to lose her house and that his powerful hockey shots translate to the more peaceful sport, he begins winning golf tournaments.As Gilmore's popularity rises, he is invited to compete in a charity event with celebrity partners. After being paired up with The Price is Right host Bob Barker, his aggressive style aggravates Barker and the partners engage in a fistfight. The memorable sequence ends with the elderly Barker knocking Gilmore out cold.Perhaps the most famous cameo in cinema, Bill Murray's appearance in Zombieland is also the most popular scene from the movie. As the film's four survivors (Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Woody Harrelson, and Abigail Breslin) traverse the wasteland of America, they stop at Murray's house to relax.Seemingly a shelter from the apocalypse outside, the survivors discover Murray is alive and well. Self-confessed super fan Tallahassee (Harrelson) gets his chance to geek out with the comic legend before they decide to prank the panicky Columbus (Eisenberg). The misguided joke results in Murray being gunned down in his home.The sequel to one of the best animated movies of the 21st century, The Lego Movie 2 picks up five years after the events of the first film. When invaders from a different planet abduct his friends, Emmet (Chris Pratt) sets out on a new journey to save them, accompanied by a mysterious stranger named Rex Dangervest.Countless characters cameo in both Lego movies, including the likes of Superman, Dumbledore, and even Abraham Lincoln. The second film features an appearance from Bruce Willis, who plays a Lego version of himself. Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) encounters the action star in an air duct, a hilarious nod to his role in Die Hard. The Lego Movie 2 is available to stream on HBO Max.One of the most meta movies ever, This is the End sees its entire cast playing larger-than-life versions of themselves. Set at a party at James Franco's house, the celebrity guests are soon confronted with the apocalypse, as a series of cataclysmic events rain down upon Los Angeles.As the survivors hide out inside Franco's house while chaos reigns outside, they are soon visited by Emma Watson, who breaks in looking for supplies. A misunderstanding causes the Harry Potter star to grow distrustful of the group, and she turns into an axe-wielding badass who drives off the men and steals their water. This is the End is available to stream on Netflix.KEEP READING: 10 Feature Length Movies That Began Life as Short FilmsTy is an Australian writer who enjoys horror movies, listening to the same bands he did fifteen years ago, and all the dogs.

And I just don't how to say it - I just fell in love with him.\"I used to come in every day and look for his number on the call sheet, it was number seven, and if his name was on the call sheet, it was an extra exciting day.\"He was three years above me and so for him he was like, 'you're like my little sister.'\"She added that nothing 'ever, ever, ever, happened romantically,' but they 'just love each other'.Unsurprisingly, Tom admitted he was aware of Emma's crush on him - but instead of acting on it, he became incredibly 'protective over her' and their friendship.The 35-year-old said: \"I think I was in the hair and make-up chair, and someone said something along the lines of, 'Yeah, she had a crush on you.'\"I became very protective over her. Yeah, I've always had a soft spot for her and that continues to the day.\"There's always been something that's like, I don't know, a kinship.\"The pals have been at the centre of romance rumours for several years. Although there's nothing romantic between the two, they regularly share photos together to their social media.Emma was previously dating American businessman Leo Robinton, but the pair reportedly split up last year.Tom was in a long-term relationship with stunt assistant Jade Olivia Gordon - who played Draco Malfoy's wife in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 - before they broke up in early 2016.Topics: Harry Potter, TV And Film, Celebrity","topImage":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=jpeg&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&dpr=1&url=https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8bbf16c2d7a209e5/bltfa2a37438a3ed534/63ac800396c8dc4c7c905a7b/https_s3-images.tyla.com_s3_content_f9586e1761cbdbd67c831535770e50d3.jpeg.jpg","date":"","author":"","description":"Emma Watson admitted she had a huge crush on her Harry Potter co-star Tom Felton, but that nothing ever happened romantically","keywords":["Harry Potter","TV And Film","Celebrity"],"_id":"63b46e023d9f429bc90fc6dc"}]
