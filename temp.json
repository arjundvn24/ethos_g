The English actress never admired being the center of attention and even admitted that the idea of too much popularity made her uncomfortable. Yet, if there’s one thing that freaked Watson out more than the spotlight, it was entering her 30s.Turning 30 automatically brought an abundance of pressure on the Little Women star’s shoulders and the plethora of expectations society had from women of a certain age didn’t help either. As Watson got brutally real about entering the scary age of 30, she opened up about the bitter reality behind not being able to enjoy that time in one’s life and how she herself struggled with the same.See also: “You’re making a big mistake”: Harry Potter Star Emma Watson Was Warned After Refusing to Work in Major Hollywood MoviesEmma Watson has had a flourishing career in Hollywood which kickstarted at the very young age of 9. From playing Hermione Granger in the blockbuster Harry Potter film series to working in independent and small-studio movies, Watson has earned recognition for her work in an array of projects. But for a woman who is on the verge of turning 30, her hard-earned success doesn’t amount to much until and unless she has also had a husband and a family by then, a burdened expectation that society tends to place on women. And that is exactly what Watson feared the most.In one of her interviews with British Vogue, the Beauty and the Beast actress admitted to being “stressed and anxious” about entering her 30s since she hadn’t conformed to the unspoken rule of having a husband and children by that age, something which apparently marked the potency of a woman.See also: “Because I turned 18, it was legal”: Emma Watson Was Left Traumatized By Paparazzi After They Tried to Click Photos Up Her Skirt By Laying on the Pavement When the Harry Potter Star Turned 18“So, I was like, ‘Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30? This is not a big deal,’ blah blah. Cut to 29, I’m like ‘Oh my god! I feel so stressed and anxious.’ And I realize it’s because there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around…if you don’t have a…if you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in something, like incredibly secure, stable place in your career, you’re still figuring things out, there’s just this, like, incredible amount of anxiety.”But while it’s no secret that Watson practically hates the limelight, she still couldn’t help but feel guilty for not enjoying it all to the fullest.The Perks of Being a Wallflower star further explained how regardless of her stance on having a family at the age of 30, she felt “guilty” for not cherishing all these aspects of life as much as a popular actress like her ought to. Be it starting a new chapter in life after turning 30 or disliking the blinding glimmer of fame, Watson was seized with contrition for “struggling” instead of being “excited” about it all.See also: “They should let her have her opinions”: Helena Bonham Carter is Not a Fan of Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe Protesting Against J.K. Rowling to Protect Their Fanbase“That’s another thing I’ve sat in therapy and felt really guilty about, to be honest, is like, ‘Why me? Why? Somebody else would’ve enjoyed and wanted this aspect of it more than I did.’ And I’ve struggled with, I’ve wrestled a lot with the guilt around that. I’ve been like, ‘I should be enjoying this more. I should be more excited.'”But, as she remarked, there was no way she could’ve known at the naive age of 9 what destiny had in store for her. And now, at the age of 32, the award-winning actress is currently one of the most renowned stars in Britain. Fate certainly has an ironic sense of humor.Source: YouTubeceleb newsEmma WatsonAn author at FandomWire, an abnormal psychology student, and an avid reader of dark fiction, I love to read and write and have been indulging in the same for years.Want more stuff like this?Get the best viral stories straight into your inbox!\n\n\n\nDon't worry, we don't spam© FandomWire, LLC.

That was reflected in how much they were paid.The Harry Potter franchise brought together actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, who rose to fame with the popularity of the movies, and consequently saw their salaries rise as the series progressed. Based on J.K. Rowling’s bestselling books, Harry Potter witnessed the blooming of Harry (Radcliffe), Ron (Grint), and Hermione’s (Watson) friendship at Hogwarts, where they met to study witchcraft and wizardry. As the Golden Trio, they faced all kinds of challenges and experiences, from bullies to first crushes and first kisses, to eventually defeating Lord Voldemort. Their friendship may have wavered, especially when Ron and Hermione became romantically involved, but they were always there for each other.While the three actors are hesitant the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, they met for the 20th-anniversary reunion special that saw Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint alongside many other actors who were part of the Harry Potter franchise. The iconic trio will forever be remembered as the best friends in the Harry Potter movies, but since then, each one has grown in their career. Radcliffe has starred in both plays and movies, most recently Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, Emma Watson earned praise for Beauty and the Beast and Little Women​​​​​​, and Rupert Grint will be returning to season 4 of Apple TV+'s Servant.Related: Every Harry Potter Movie and TV ShowSince becoming internationally renowned for the franchise, Radcliffe has filmed a lot since Harry Potter. However, rewinding back to 2001, the young actor was being cast for his biggest role yet as The Boy Who Lived, and he was perfect as the mischievous and courageous 11-year-old wizard. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Radcliffe made $1 million for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. As the titular character with the most scenes and lines, his pay increased substantially with each sequel, and by the time Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 wrapped up, Radcliffe earned a combined $50 million dollars for the final two parts.After her famous role as Hermione Granger, Watson has had prominent roles since Harry Potter. Introduced as a brilliant Muggle-born witch, Hermione became an integral part of the trio, serving as the voice of reason, and perpetually saving her two friends from many difficult situations thanks to her intelligence and wits. Watson was cast at the age of 10 and according to Parade, made less than $1 million for the first movie. However, growing in popularity both on and off-screen for her role as the wisest member of the Golden Trio, the actress’s salary rose considerably up to $30 million for the two-part finale of the Harry Potter franchise.Rounding out the trio, Grint played a perfect Ron Weasley. The sixth of seven children in the Weasley family, Ron proved himself a loyal friend to Harry, and stood by him alongside Hermione through good times and bad, ultimately defeating Voldemort and keeping their friendship strong 19 years later. As said by the directors during the 20th-anniversary reunion, Rupert “was” Ron and fit the character perfectly, which likely resulted in a steady pay increase. Grint’s first pay for The Sorcerer’s Stone in 2001 was under $1 million (Celebrity Net Worth) His salary grew to $4 million mid-franchise, reaching $30 million as a combined pay for the two-part Harry Potter finale.More: Harry Potter Spin-Off Movies Have The Same Problem As Star Wars","topImage":"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/voldemort-with-bellatrix-lestrange-lucius-malfoy-and-other-masked-death-eaters-1.jpg","date":"2023-01-06T20:30:11Z","author":"","description":"Which Harry Potter star was paid the most?","keywords":""},{"title":"A Movie Emma Watson Refused to Star In Made $447 Million and Got 6 Oscars","text":"Harry Potter star Emma Watson once turned down an offer that could have made her even more famous, but she does not regret her decision because it helped her fulfill one of her childhood dreams.\"When they offered me Belle, I just felt the character resonated with me so much... She remains curious, compassionate, and open-minded. And that's the kind of woman I would want to embody as a role model, given the choice,\" Watson said of her preference to star in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. (via) The actress revealed she watched a lot of Disney movies growing up.But what was the offer she turned down? Well, Emma Watson was offered the lead role in Damien Chazelle's romantic musical comedy-drama La La Land, starring Ryan Gosling and another Emma – Stone. The film won 6 Oscars and grossed an impressive 447 million worldwide – 10 times its budget.While starring in the 2017 remake of Beauty and the Beast may have been Watson's dream, the reviews of her performance were rather disappointing. Some of the cruelest comments described her as giving one of the weaker performances of the cast.Cinephiles shared their impressions in a thread on Reddit that is honestly painful to read for any Watson fan.One of the commenters was particularly ruthless, saying that the Hermione actress was neither a beauty – just average – nor a good singer. Her acting was weak, stale, forced and stiff. The fact that she refused to wear a corset, driven by her own agenda, was bad for the movie, because what else can be the most beautiful classic Disney dress?And the bottom line is that Anne Hathaway should have played Belle. What a verdict! Some said the only part she's good at is Hermione because that's who she is in real life.One commenter went so far as to say, \"The one thing the Beauty and the Beast remake did really well was remind fans how lucky they are that Emma Watson and Miles Teller were replaced by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in La La Land.\"It should be noted, however, that for all the criticism directed at Watson in particular, Beauty and the Beast did quite well. Within ten days of its opening, it became the highest grossing live-action musical of all time, surpassing Mamma Mia! at the box office. In total, it grossed over 1.2 billion internationally.Whatever happens next, we love Henry anyway.","topImage":"https://startefacts.com/upload//upload/news/138546855658.jpg","date":"","author":"","description":"Harry Potter star Emma Watson once turned down an offer that could have made her even more famous, but she does not regret her decision because it helped her fulfill one of her childhood dreams.\r\n","keywords":""},{"title":"Emma Watson Made $70 Million From The Harry Potter Franchise, But She Also Retained The Rights To Her Iconic Wardrobe","text":"Emma Watson got to keep her iconic Harry Potter wardrobe, along with a huge salary for the film.Emma Watson has starred in a variety of roles, including her iconic performance as Hermione Granger, and also uses her clothes to show off how well one can look in recycled materials. She earned international fame playing Hermione Granger in the beloved Harry Potter films.The wildly popular series earned Watson $70 million alone. However, the star is known for more than just her acting. Taking control of her outfits on the red carpet, her wardrobe includes many amazing eco-friendly outfits.Not only does she wear clothes re-created from things thrown away every day, she speaks out about important environmental matters. There are many who might wonder about Watson's love life. Instead, the actor prefers to promote issues important to her, including women's rights and the environment.Emma Watson became a high-earning star because of her role in the Harry Potter series and now uses fashion to promote her activism.Cast at nine years old, Emma Watson was memorizing lines and shooting her first film, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, at a young age. Watson, along with co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, became a globally-recognized star as the three grew up on-screen.She went on to star in seven more films in the Harry Potter franchise, earning herself $70 million in the process. Her parents helped prepare her for the fame that came with being easily recognized. She says her iconic first character has helped her find her own style.In an interview with WWD, she said, \"I have Hermione to thank, in a weird way, for my sense of style. Playing this role, fashion was my way of expressing myself away from that school uniform. When I got the chance to dress myself, I was so thrilled to be able to be Emma and show a different side of myself.\"As Hermione, Emma Watson had to wear her hair, nails and clothes in a careful uniform. She also had to wear the same costume every day. This seems to have had an effect on her, and now she says she finds freedom in fashion.While speaking with WWD she said, \"Maybe I would never have been this interested in fashion if I hadn't played that role for so long and sometimes felt so constrained by being identified with her so much. I just wasn't allowed to do anything: wasn't allowed to cut my hair, put on nail varnish, tan, wear a bra that made my boobs in any way look [larger], have any flesh showing, wear any makeup when I was playing Hermione.\"That seems like a lot of restrictions for anyone! It's no surprise that after having to wear, or not wear, the same thing all the time, Watson found a voice in her iconic wardrobe. \"Fashion was my rebellion,\" she said to WWD.After rising to world-wide fame as Hermione Granger, the actress seemed to feel disconnected. She told Vanity Fair, \"I'd walk down the red carpet and go into the bathroom. I had on so much makeup and these big, fluffy, full-on dresses.\"She continued, stating, \"I'd put my hands on the sink and look myself in the mirror and say, 'Who is this?' I didn't connect with the person who was looking back at me, and that was a very unsettling feeling.\"Watson used fashion to update Belle's look in Beauty and the Beast. According to Vanity Fair, \"Watson worked with costume designer Jacqueline Durran to incorporate pockets in her costume that are 'kind of like a tool belt.'\"Watson also told Vanity Fair, \"The original sketches had her (Belle) in her ballet shoes, which are lovely-don't get me wrong-but she's not going to be able to do anything terribly useful in ballet shoes in the middle of a French provincial village.\" Watson was able to wear riding boots for the role, giving her character an updated look.It seems that clothes mean something to Emma Watson. After wearing the same uniform while playing Hermione Granger, she's able to freely express herself using her outfits. She can also give some of her characters a new look using fashion.Emma Watson has been able to use the attention she attracts to shine a light on big issues. Appointed a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in 2014, she helped start the HeForShe campaign. HeForShe is the UN's global movement for gender equality.A book lover, she started an online feminist book club, Our Shared Shelf. It's a bi-monthly book club that currently has over 360 thousand followers on Instagram.In an article with UN Women, Watson stated, \"Being asked to serve as UN Women's Goodwill Ambassador is truly humbling. The chance to make a real difference is not an opportunity that everyone is given and is one I have no intention of taking lightly.\"Emma Watson also uses her wardrobe to raise awareness. She created an instagram account that features her eco-friendly fashion and showed off many of her outfits from her Beauty and the Beast press tour. She also wore a dress to the 2016 Met Gala that was created from recycled plastic bottles.The Calvin Klein dress she wore to the Met Gala isn't the only time she has worn eco-friendly attire.

Whether it is a famous actor randomly passing by or an offscreen character that reveals themselves as a familiar face, cameos get people talking. Marvel has made a habit of it, always including the late Stan Lee in their movies while also featuring cameos from heroes and random celebrities.RELATED: 10 Sitcom Cameos That You Completely Forgot AboutWhile it is always great seeing a famous actor in a surprise appearance, sometimes the most memorable cameos are when the stars play themselves. These appearances are often at their own expense, playing an unlikable version of themselves or being dragged into some dangerous scheme. It is always lovely to see an actor not taking themselves too seriously, and the below ten are some of the best instances.Everyone loves Keanu Reeves, so it seems perfect to include him as a rival in a romantic comedy. Always Be My Maybe stars Ali Wong as Sasha, a celebrity chef who returns to her hometown to open a new restaurant. There she reunites with her childhood crush, Marcus (Randall Park) and their complicated relationship reignites.One of the best scenes in is when Sasha agrees to a double date with Marcus and his girlfriend, with Sasha's date being none other than Reeves. Mr. Wick plays an eccentric version of himself, spouting nonsense as if he is a spiritual guru, and the fact that Reeves is willing to poke fun at himself makes him even more endearing. Always Be My Maybe is available to stream on Netflix.Stan Lee is the undisputed champion of cameos, appearing in countless Marvel movies, so much so that one of the highlights of going to see a new MCU was waiting to see where he would pop up next. While his role in Mallrats is larger than his Marvel appearances, it is still a minor part that does not occur until near the end.The film sees Jason Lee and Jeremy London starring as two slackers who spend their days at the mall while pining for their ex-girlfriends. While there, Brodie (Lee) encounters the comic book legend, and he offers the teenager some profound advice about love, showcasing a genuinely touching performance from the great man.Another comedy from Kevin Smith, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back follows the two characters after their stint in Mallrats as they head to Hollywood to stop a movie that is being made about them. The film is filled with celebrity cameos, as stars such as Carrie Fisher, Chris Rock, and Mark Hamill all make appearances.One of the most memorable moments is when Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are seen on a studio set. Filming a sequel to their classic movie Good Will Hunting, dubbed 'Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season', the pair parody their previous film's dialogue before Damon whips out a shotgun and blows his rival away. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is available to stream on Showtime.Before his legendary turn as Barney Stinson in How I Met Your Mother, Neil Patrick Harris endeared himself to modern audiences through his appearances in the Harold & Kumar series. The first movie sees stoners Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) embark on a wild journey to White Castle in order to satisfy their munchies.The best friends encounter Harris, who at the time was best known for his role in Doogie Howser, M.D. The former child actor is nothing like they imagined as he takes drugs, steals their car, and uses it to have sex with prostitutes. His outrageous behavior helps Harold & Kumar earn its place as one of the best stoner movies. Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle is available to stream on HBO Max.Coming from the minds behind Key & Peele, Keanu stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as a pair of best friends who lose their beloved kitten, Keanu. Discovering the kitten has been adopted by a dangerous gang leader, the friends pose as notorious assassins, so they can infiltrate his gang and take their kitten back.Anna Faris has made a name for herself by placing wacky characters, and Keanu sees her at her craziest. Playing a heightened version of herself, Faris engages in a drug deal with Rell (Peele) and Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish). A coked-up Faris offers to pay Hi-C to shoot Rell, so she can see what his brains look like.One of the most popular cartoons of the 21st century, SpongeBob SquarePants is beloved by fans worldwide. The movie follows SpongeBob and Patrick as they embark on a journey to clear Mr. Krabs's name after he is accused of stealing King Neptune's crown. Of course, the pair find themselves in constant trouble.Towards the end of the film, once SpongeBob and Patrick retrieve the crown, they find themselves lost. Who else would appear and offer them a ride than David Hasselhoff? The pair hop on The Hoff and ride him across the ocean, even engaging in a fight with the film's big bad across the Baywatch star's bare back. The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is available to stream on Paramount+.One of Adam Sandler's best movies, Happy Gilmore sees the funnyman playing the titular failed hockey player who tries his hand at golf. Discovering that his beloved grandmother is going to lose her house and that his powerful hockey shots translate to the more peaceful sport, he begins winning golf tournaments.As Gilmore's popularity rises, he is invited to compete in a charity event with celebrity partners. After being paired up with The Price is Right host Bob Barker, his aggressive style aggravates Barker and the partners engage in a fistfight. The memorable sequence ends with the elderly Barker knocking Gilmore out cold.Perhaps the most famous cameo in cinema, Bill Murray's appearance in Zombieland is also the most popular scene from the movie. As the film's four survivors (Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Woody Harrelson, and Abigail Breslin) traverse the wasteland of America, they stop at Murray's house to relax.Seemingly a shelter from the apocalypse outside, the survivors discover Murray is alive and well. Self-confessed super fan Tallahassee (Harrelson) gets his chance to geek out with the comic legend before they decide to prank the panicky Columbus (Eisenberg). The misguided joke results in Murray being gunned down in his home.The sequel to one of the best animated movies of the 21st century, The Lego Movie 2 picks up five years after the events of the first film. When invaders from a different planet abduct his friends, Emmet (Chris Pratt) sets out on a new journey to save them, accompanied by a mysterious stranger named Rex Dangervest.Countless characters cameo in both Lego movies, including the likes of Superman, Dumbledore, and even Abraham Lincoln. The second film features an appearance from Bruce Willis, who plays a Lego version of himself. Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) encounters the action star in an air duct, a hilarious nod to his role in Die Hard. The Lego Movie 2 is available to stream on HBO Max.One of the most meta movies ever, This is the End sees its entire cast playing larger-than-life versions of themselves. Set at a party at James Franco's house, the celebrity guests are soon confronted with the apocalypse, as a series of cataclysmic events rain down upon Los Angeles.As the survivors hide out inside Franco's house while chaos reigns outside, they are soon visited by Emma Watson, who breaks in looking for supplies.

And I just don't how to say it - I just fell in love with him.\"I used to come in every day and look for his number on the call sheet, it was number seven, and if his name was on the call sheet, it was an extra exciting day.\"He was three years above me and so for him he was like, 'you're like my little sister.'\"She added that nothing 'ever, ever, ever, happened romantically,' but they 'just love each other'.Unsurprisingly, Tom admitted he was aware of Emma's crush on him - but instead of acting on it, he became incredibly 'protective over her' and their friendship.The 35-year-old said: \"I think I was in the hair and make-up chair, and someone said something along the lines of, 'Yeah, she had a crush on you.'\"I became very protective over her. Yeah, I've always had a soft spot for her and that continues to the day.\"There's always been something that's like, I don't know, a kinship.\"The pals have been at the centre of romance rumours for several years. Although there's nothing romantic between the two, they regularly share photos together to their social media.Emma was previously dating American businessman Leo Robinton, but the pair reportedly split up last year.Tom was in a long-term relationship with stunt assistant Jade Olivia Gordon - who played Draco Malfoy's wife in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 - before they broke up in early 2016.Topics: Harry Potter, TV And Film, Celebrity","topImage":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=jpeg&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&dpr=1&url=https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8bbf16c2d7a209e5/bltfa2a37438a3ed534/63ac800396c8dc4c7c905a7b/https_s3-images.tyla.com_s3_content_f9586e1761cbdbd67c831535770e50d3.jpeg.jpg","date":"","author":"","description":"Emma Watson admitted she had a huge crush on her Harry Potter co-star Tom Felton, but that nothing ever happened romantically","keywords":["Harry Potter","TV And Film","Celebrity"]},{"title":"\"Everyone knows he used to be a stripper\": Emma Watson Couldn't Handle Seeing Channing Tatum in a Thong in 'This is the End', Reportedly Walked Out of Set in Disgust - FandomWire","text":"Switch to the light mode that's kinder on your eyes at day time.Switch to the dark mode that's kinder on your eyes at night time.\n\n\n\nDon't worry, we don't spam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are here: \n\n\nby\n\n\nSang Tonsing\n\n\nDecember 23, 2022, 7:40 am \n\n\nEmma Watson has for so long been considered by the internet as the most beautiful woman in the world, and all the subreddits, fan websites, fan pages, and so on only go one to prove it.

It’s got almost everything you want in a big-budget comedy movie- a star-studded cast of well-known actors, an apocalyptic setting, and of course, tons of giggles and laughs.But underneath all the work it took to complete the movie, there was one incident that occurred during its filming process which reportedly led to one of its stars, Emma Watson, storming out of the set.Related: “They should let her have her opinions”: Helena Bonham Carter is Not a Fan of Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe Protesting Against J.K. Rowling to Protect Their FanbaseAccording to one of the extras who worked on the movie, the incident came about when the Harry Potter actress came to the set of the movie, and to her shock, she saw Channing Tatum wearing only a thong. She reacted in disgust, and apparently, stormed off the set of the movie.The extra said-“Emma knew he was going to be in a thong and everyone knows he used to be a stripper. So things were starting to get raunchy. Emma steps on set and looks at the scene and all of us in it and kind of has a freak out moment.”“Before we started to film she stormed off set with her publicist and Seth was saying what happened what’s wrong with Emma? Then she came back and filmed about 3 minutes of the scene.”Well, it’s surprising that she managed to do the scene, even after such a vulgar display by Tatum on his end.Also Read: “Because I turned 18, it was legal”: Emma Watson Was Left Traumatized By Paparazzi After They Tried to Click Photos Up Her Skirt By Laying on the Pavement When the Harry Potter Star Turned 18After having made up to Emma Watson by apologizing about the Channing Tatum-with-a-thong-on incident after an interview with GQ, Seth Rogen sought to do more good back in 2021 by clearing up any misinformation about the whole situation.Related: “I wanted them to know that not everybody felt that way”: Daniel Radcliffe Reveals Why He Went Against J.K.

He starred as the infamous potions teacher in all eight of the wizarding films from 2001 to 2011.The actor passed away in 2016 at the age of 69, and since his death a number of his private journals have been made public.In one of his entries, which was published in The Guardian earlier this year, Rickman revealed that he was actually quite unhappy working on the Harry Potter films and even came close to leaving the franchise.He admitted to having several problems on set and struggled with everything from his working hours to his co-stars, particularly the child actors.Although Alan Rickman had plenty of scenes with adult cast members, he also spent a lot of time with the younger actors on set, such as Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint.He was critical of their ability to remember lines, and was particularly critical of Emma Watson's acting ability. When discussing the children he shared scenes with, Rickman wrote:“These kids need directing. They don’t know their lines and Emma [Watson]’s diction is this side of Albania at times.“Plus my so-called rehearsal is with a stand-in who is French.”Steven Spielberg 'truly regrets' impact of Jaws on shark populationThese entries were written around the time of filming for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 2004.But it turns out Rickman had serious doubts about his role in the franchise and came very close to leaving after only a couple of films.While filming the second installment, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, in 2002, the actor suggested a discussion was ongoing about him leaving the franchise.He wrote: “Talking to [agent] Paul Lyon-Maris about HP exit, which he thinks will happen. But here we are in the project-collision area again. Reiterating no more HP. They don’t want to hear it.”As we all know though, Rickman saw through the Harry Potter films until the end. This was because of Snape's character arc, which JK Rowling had told him about years before it was revealed in the final book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.In an entry shared from 2007, Rickman wrote: “I have finished reading the last ‘Harry Potter’ book.“Snape dies heroically, Potter describes him to his children as one of the bravest men he ever knew and calls his son Albus Severus. This was a genuine rite of passage.“One small piece of information from Jo Rowling seven years ago – Snape loved Lily – gave me a cliff edge to hang on to.”Rickman’s diary entries are now available in the book ‘Madly, Deeply: The Diaries of Alan Rickman’.Related links: ","topImage":"https://img.maximummedia.ie/joe_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL20wLmpvZS5pZVxcXC93cC1jb250ZW50XFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyMlxcXC8xMlxcXC8yNzE1MTkwNFxcXC9SaWNrbWFuLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5qb2UuaWVcXFwvYXNzZXRzXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9qb2VcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nP2lkPTI2NGEyZGJlMzcwZjJjNjc1ZmNkXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjYxNGEyYzM4M2FmYjczNzdmNTkxZjY1ODVkMzhmMjVjYWI4MzA5YjcifQ==/rickman.jpg","date":"","author":"","description":"Alan Rickman had a very specific Emma Watson criticism in his diary entries","keywords":["Movies &amp; TV"," Film"," entertainment"," Harry Potter"," Emma Watson"," Alan Rickman"]},{"title":"Harry Potter Dudley Actor Recalls Isolating Filming Experience","text":"Dudley actor Harry Melling recalls how filming the Harry Potter movies was somewhat isolating and how his experience differed from his co-stars.Harry Potter actor Harry Melling, who played Dudley Dursley, recalls how filming the franchise was sometimes an isolating experience. Based on the beloved novels by author J.K. Rowling, the Warner Bros. film series kicked off in 2001 with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The film, like the book, picks up with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) living with the Dursleys and frequently being tormented by his cousin, Dudley, before he is whisked off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Although the Harry Potter films focus mostly on the magical side of Harry's life with Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), Dudley and the Dursleys do continue to appear, however briefly, in later films.Now, more than 11 years since the last Harry Potter film was released, Melling reflects on his experience filming the franchise in a recent interview with EW. The actor reveals that, as a supporting character in the real, non-magical part of the world, his filming experience, which much shorter in length, was one that felt mostly disconnected from the larger production. Check out Melling's full comment about his time on the Harry Potter films below:\n\"My experience was unique in terms of I wasn't in it throughout the entire shoot. The earthly sequences would very much be an isolated filming block. So, I dipped in, and then I went back to school and normal life.\"Related: Every Harry Potter Character Who Uses An Unforgivable CurseApart from a recent reunion special, audiences last saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione back in 2011 in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2. Rowling's Wizarding World would continue, however, in Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them in 2016 and its two subsequent sequels. After the relatively poor reception to Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore last year, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav made several comments that some interpreted as meaning the Wizarding World franchise was dead. While it seems unlikely that Warner Bros. will move forward with any additional sequels in the Fantastic Beasts franchise, Harry Potter remains such a valuable piece of IP that it's hard to imagine there won't be more films or shows in the future.Zaslav, who has made clear that Warner Bros. will be focusing on building successful franchises in the coming years, has also previously expressed interest in striking up additional content deals with Rowling for more movies in that universe. To that end, HBO Max executive Sarah Aubrey confirmed last November that the company is still interested in creating additional Harry Potter content. In fact, it was revealed several weeks after Aubrey's comment that Warner Bros. may be interested in adapting Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a stage play, into a feature film. If and when the franchise does return, it seems likely that the new movie will serve as a launchpad for future content, potentially including live-action shows.While Watson and Grint have both expressed a willingness to return to the Harry Potter franchise, at least under certain circumstances, Radcliffe has made clear that it's not something he's interested in at the moment. This means that, whatever is next for the franchise, it probably won't include older versions of Harry, Ron, or Hermione. While the future of the Harry Potter franchise is very much unknown at this point, fans should expect to hear more official announcements from Warner Bros. Discovery over the next year or two in terms of where the Wizarding World will go next.More: Harry Potter: What Dudley Saw When The Dementors AttackedSource: EWRyan Northrup is a Senior Writer at Screen Rant and a contributor at MovieBozo and Flickfeast.

Though she didn’t have any professional acting credits, she managed to beat out thousands for the role of Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies. The actor would devote a full decade of her life to filming and promoting the blockbuster films. Furthermore, the films would make her a household name, impacting all sectors of her life. From her education to her career and even the way she approached dates. Dating can be tricky for anyone, whether they’re famous or not. However, Watson’s celebrity status has certainly impacted how she sets up dates for herself. While online dating has become more commonplace, apps are out of the question for the Brown University alumna. In an interview with Vogue, The Perks of Being a Wallflower actor shared that you’ll never find her on Tinder, Hinge, or the like. “Dating apps are not on the cards for me,” she shared.So how does Watson meet potential partners? While she attended her Ivy League college, she was able to meet people organically. But now that she’s been out of school for years, she’s not exposed to as many people. Fortunately, the actor has friends who are capable of setting her up on some great dates. “I’m very lucky in the sense that because I went to university and because I’ve done these other things outside of film, my friends are really good at setting me up,” Watson explained. “Really good.”In fact, Watson’s friends are so good at setting her up that many of her past dates have become good friends of hers. Even when things don’t click romantically, there was enough mutual interest and appreciation for a friendship to blossom naturally. “And what’s really nice is some of my best friends are people I got set up on a date with, and it didn’t work out,” Watson admitted.It might be hard for some people to imagine being close friends with someone they went on dates with. In fact, Watson was one of those people before it happened to her. Before she began befriending her former dates, she considered it an impossibility. “I didn’t think it was possible,” Watson revealed. “And it really is possible.

Cast to portray Hermione Granger and The Chosen One in the Harry Potter movies, they dealt with an extraordinary amount of fame. After devoting a decade of their lives to filming and promoting the blockbuster films, they moved on to other ventures. But, the fame they’ve accrued from the films still affects their day-to-day lives. In fact, it’s even affected their dating lives in the past.Dating can be difficult for the average person. However, when you’re a famous celebrity, there’s an additional set of difficulties that come into play. Unlike others, Watson probably couldn’t just join a dating app without causing a commotion. Instead, Watson has found many of her past boyfriends through mutual friends. Still, the actor has suffered through some dating doozies. She has shared that people have even asked her if she’s “the girl from Harry Potter” while on dates.But Watson has had some weird Harry Potter moments even when a date is going well. While speaking with British Vogue, the Little Women alum recalled a time when she was making out with a guy, and one of the eight Harry Potter movies that she starred in started playing in the background. Watson admits to being caught off guard and not knowing what to do.“I’ll be making out with someone and then I am on the telly behind us,” Watson shared. “And all I can hear is the Harry Potter theme tune as I’m kissing someone, and I’m like, ‘Do I turn it off? Do I just ignore this? Is he thinking about this? Is it just me thinking about this? Maybe he doesn’t know what the Harry Potter theme tune sounds like. Maybe it’s just me.’”Of course, Watson isn’t the only one who’s had a weird Harry Potter moment while dating. While speaking with Collider, Radcliffe shared that fans have approached him while he’s out on a date, with friends, and with family, and it’s a bit of a strange situation for him. \n\t\t\n\t\t\tDaniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson Only Felt Famous for a Few Weeks a Year\t\t\n\t“I mean, you know, if you’re on a date and somebody comes up and says, ‘Oh, I loved you in Harry Potter,’ it’s a bit weird, because you suddenly start thinking, ‘Oh, God.  Is this weird for the other person I’m here with, or is this weird for my family?'” Radcliffe shared. Clearly, being in the Harry Potter movies has impacted almost every sector of Watson and Radcliffe’s lives. Dating might present a unique set of challenges to the actors.

Considering the actor spent a full decade of her life filming and promoting the wildly popular movies, it’s a good thing that she enjoyed a lot of her time on set. However, playing Hermione Granger wasn’t always the magical experience that fans assume it was. In fact, there were times when the actor was fairly miserable on set. But what is the worst memory that Watson has from her experience making the eight movies?Interestingly enough, the Harry Potter movie that has the highest ratings amongst critics and fans was the one that was the most challenging for Watson to film. Not only was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2 mentally demanding for Watson, given the subject matter, but it was also a physically demanding shoot. While speaking with JoBlo, Watson reflected on filming the final film in the franchise. “We spent pretty much the whole of Part 2 soaking wet,” the Noah actor recalled. There was one particular scene from the last Harry Potter movie that Watson truly hated filming. Fans will recall that after stealing one of Voldemort’s Horcruxes from Gringotts, the trio narrowly avoids capture by escaping on a dragon. Then, before the dragon can notice their presence, they opt to drop into a lake. While the scene may have been stunning to watch, filming it was a completley different story.“I can tell you the worst right now,” Watson shared about the worst time she had while filming the Harry Potter movies. “It was on movie #2, we get dropped by a dragon into the lake, and I think it was January or February. The lake wasn’t heated, and because we had to get changed as part of the next scene, we couldn’t wear anything underneath. I was lucky. I had my bottom half with some thermals on, but I was like, ‘This must be a joke.’ It was so cold.”Continuing on, Watson shared that the scene wasn’t just hard for her. Her fellow Harry Potter castmates Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe felt that the cold was challenging to contend with also. They eventually got through it, but filming the scene certainly left an indelible impression on the Beauty and the Beast star. \n\t\t\n\t\t\tDaniel Radcliffe Gave Emma Watson a ’10 out of 10 for Kissing’\t\t\n\t“I think Rupert thought at one point that his heart had stopped beating,” Watson shared. “I hate being cold more than anything, so that was my most memorable day. I was like, ‘I can’t wait for this to be over!’” Filming the dragon lake scene may have been challenging for Watson, but it definitely prepared her for a career in acting. Watson has shared that nothing in her career will ever be as challenging as the Harry Potter movies, so it seems she’s ready for whatever challenging role she chooses to accept next.","topImage":"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Harry-Potter-alum-Emma-Watson.jpg?w=1200","date":"2022-12-25T18:00:00+00:00","author":"Abeni Tinubu","description":"Emma Watson spent a full decade of her life filming the 'Harry Potter' movies.

Rowling such a terrible person?’: Harry Potter Author Invites Internet’s Wrath for Incredibly Insensitive “Merry Terfmas” Anti-Trans TweetEmma Watson, like the real-life Hermione she is, is doing exactly what you’d expect of her (and her character), after the end of the Harry Potter movie series- activism. Becoming a UN Goodwill Ambassador, and founding the Time’s Up UK NGO, she’s closely following the footsteps of her character.It’s pretty clear that the 32-year-old actress was destined for greater heights and bigger goals ever since she jumped into the spotlight after her work in the Harry Potter series. This is why when she was asked by Prisoner of Azkaban director, Alfonso Cuaron, to write an essay on her character- she ended up writing a whopping 16 pages about the Muggle-born!As for the franchise’s leading star Daniel Radcliffe, who plays the titular character, he has done all he can to branch out his career after the end of the fantasy series in 2011- starring in numerous movies like The Cripple of Inishmaan, Swiss Army Man, and so on. However, unlike co-star Watson, when asked for a similar essay, he was only able to manage a single page on his character.Related: “They should let her have her opinions”: Helena Bonham Carter is Not a Fan of Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe Protesting Against J.K. Rowling to Protect Their FanbaseThe final piece in the Harry Potter trio is completed by Rupert Grint’s Ron Weasley. He’s also got a lot going on- he’ll be starring in M. Night Shyamalan’s Knock at the Cabin as well as work on Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities. Unlike his two co-actors at the time, Grint couldn’t even manage to write a single page to present to Cuaron- because he had exams!As fans can see, the legendary childhood trio of every fantasy-loving adult today was quite funny on their own.Also Read: “Because I turned 18, it was legal”: Emma Watson Was Left Traumatized By Paparazzi After They Tried to Click Photos Up Her Skirt By Laying on the Pavement When the Harry Potter Star Turned 18It’s no doubt that this little anecdote about the three most memorable Harry Potter stars is amusing to fans, in fact, it fits their character to the T.Related: “I wanted them to know that not everybody felt that way”: Daniel Radcliffe Reveals Why He Went Against J.K.

But Emma Watson, who portrayed the bright-eyed, intelligent, witch, was even younger than her character. Watson was just nine when she was cast in the Harry Potter film franchise, and her entire life changed. A true example of an overnight celebrity, Watson was flung headfirst into staggering amounts of fame, scrutiny, and wealth. Interestingly, Watson wasn’t chasing celebrity status when she auditioned for Harry Potter.  In fact, she wasn’t even sure she wanted to make acting her career. What she did know, however, was that she was destined to portray Hermione. A voracious reader and serious-minded child, she felt a strong synergy with the witch and felt she was the perfect person to bring the character to life.Ultimately, the powers that be agreed with Watson, and she was cast in the highly-anticipated films. And while Watson’s initial contract was only for the first two films, the Noah actor would act in all eight movies. It’s safe to say that the films took over Watson’s life for a full decade. In many ways, they defined her childhood. In fact, Watson has shared that her memories prior to being cast are fairly scant. “I got cast in Harry Potter when I was nine years old… I don’t even have that many memories from before,” Watson revealed in a conversation with Vogue. Being cast in a global franchise was obviously a life-changing experience for Watson, but it’s also one that she has struggled with. Because so much of her life has been about Harry Potter, it’s sometimes difficult for people to realize that she has an identity that is removed from her character. In fact, she even has to remind some of her closest friends that she’s not Hermione.“Even people that are really close to me sometimes can’t let it go,” Watson shared of the character that made her famous. “Or see just me. And then sometimes I have to go, ‘No, no – I need exactly what you need. I’m just as human as you are. I’m just as insecure as you are. I struggle just as much as you struggle.'”\n\t\t\n\t\t\tDaniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson Needed Friends Outside of ‘Harry Potter’\t\t\n\tFor her part, Watson admits that her celebrity status has sometimes overwhelmed her. It’s then that the Harry Potter alum has to connect with her own identity. She finds solace in recalling who she is outside of being an actor. “I am a sister,” Watson shared. “I belong to a family… There’s a whole existence and identity that I have, actually, that’s really important and weighted and solid that has nothing to do with any of that.” Clearly, achieving fame at such a young age impacted Watson’s life. However, she seems to have found some ways to navigate it.","topImage":"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Harry-Potter-stars-Rupert-Grint-Daniel-Radcliffe-and-Emma-Watson.jpg?w=1200","date":"2022-12-08T18:46:20+00:00","author":"Abeni Tinubu","description":"Emma Watson admitted her memories of life before joining the 'Harry Potter' cast are very few and far between.","keywords":""},{"title":"“Blackout was kind of my thing”: Daniel Radcliffe Started Heavily Drinking at the End of Harry Potter Franchise, Panicked For His Career - FandomWire","text":"Switch to the light mode that's kinder on your eyes at day time.Switch to the dark mode that's kinder on your eyes at night time.\n\n\n\nDon't worry, we don't spam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are here: \n\n\nby\n\n\nSang Tonsing\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2023, 12:26 pm \n\n\nIt’s barely been a week since everyone transitioned into the new year after a tumultuous 2022 which saw too many unfortunate events happen.

The realization that his career might come to a close after the release of the last Harry Potter movie in 2011 really took a toll on Radcliffe’s mental health, as he spiraled into alcoholism to cope with the nearing end of probably his biggest role in Hollywood ever.A Must-Read: ‘Prisoner of Azkaban’ Director Asked Harry Potter Trio To Write an Essay on Their Character – Emma Watson Wrote 16 Pages, Daniel Radcliffe Had a 1 Page Summary, Rupert Grint Didn’t Write OneThe release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was the final installment in the decade-spanning Harry Potter franchise. It was the end of an era for fans of the franchise who had closely followed the adventures of the titular character, along with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.The three respective actors who played in these roles- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, had gone from child stars to fully grown versions of their characters in the franchise.When a fanbase grows up with a cast that grows in age along with them, then the connection is simply just deeper between fans and the stars of the TV series or movie. This is why Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was the worst blow to the Harry Potter franchise and its fanbase, as it all had come to an end.Related: ‘Why is J.K.

He further added that he turned it up a notch when he got doubtful about his future after the end of the Harry Potter movie series-“A lot of drinking happened toward the end of Potter and for a little bit after it finished. It was panic a little bit, not knowing what to do next. Not being — comfortable enough in who I was to remain sober.” Thankfully Radcliffe ended up getting roles in less-popular but as good movies such as Swiss Army Knife Man, and he has now settled well into television series like Miracle Workers.Also Read: “They should let her have her opinions”: Helena Bonham Carter is Not a Fan of Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe Protesting Against J.K.

On one hand, all three actors were ready to move on to new experiences after devoting a decade of their lives to the eight films. On the other hand, saying goodbye to the franchise that defined much of their childhood and adolescent experiences was an emotional affair. And, of course, bidding each other farewell wasn’t the easiest experience. Thus, it makes sense that the trio swapped gifts as mementos of the 10 years they spent working together. Grint, Watson, and Radcliffe have always been candid about the fact that they got on famously. The trio considered each other family and are still in contact today. All three actors have acknowledged that they have a unique shared experience that binds them together. And when their time working together finally came to an end, they showed their affection for each other by giving each other presents.But just what were these presents? While speaking with Collider, Grint revealed that he gifted his Harry Potter castmates with pretty bizarre tokens of his affections. “Yeah, I got Dan and Emma trumpets,” Grint revealed. The Servant actor divulged that neither he nor Radcliffe nor Watson played the brass instrument. Furthermore, the musical instruments didn’t represent a special moment or even an inside joke.  “I don’t know quite why I did it,” Grint explained. “There’s no reason at all,” he continued. “The trumpets were just random.” While the instruments were random, Grint did take care to add sentimental value to the bizarre gifts he gave Watson and Radcliffe. “I engraved the trumpets,” Grint shared. But with what? “Just a little kind of message to both of them,” he explained. “I actually hand-engraved it too, I got, like, an engraving kit.”Grint’s gifts may have been bizarre, but the sentiment behind his presents was certainly sweet. But what did Watson and Radcliffe gift Grint with? “Dan got me a really nice still from one of the films,” Grint remembered. “He kind of made fun of me in it and signed it, yeah it was really nice. It was a scene where Dan was kind of climbing on my head and his foot was kind of crushing my head.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\t‘Harry Potter’: Emma Watson and Rupert Grint Had a Sweet Celebration on the Last Day of Filming\t\t\n\tWatson’s gift to Grint was easily the most practical. “She got me a diary thing,” Grint explained. “Like a leather diary.” At the time, Grint had yet to write in the diary. However, it’s a memento that he’ll always treasure. “I’ll always keep it, it’s cool,” he added. While the Harry Potter trio’s gifts to one another may be a bit unusual, it’s clear that they were appreciative of the time they spent together.

One of the most popular topics of heated debate is the question of which actors in the entire Harry Potter movie franchise gave the worst interpretation of the character from the books in the movies. Many fans will argue that each actor had a different argument for \"worst performance,\" and while we partially agree, we still tried to compile the most fair and just list of the worst acting performances with a summary of both pros and cons.Michael Gambon as Albus DumbledoreDumbledore was originally played by Richard Harris in the earliest two Harry Potter films until his death in 2002. From then on, Gambon took over for the following six. The biggest gripe against Gambon is how his character strayed away from the source material canon. In the books, Dumbledore was always calm and collected, never losing his composure. Gambon's portrayal came off as too \"angry\" for some fans. One example is the scene in \"Order of the Phoenix\" in which he shouts, \"Don't you all have studying to do?\" Maybe this was more on the screenplay than the acting, but still, it could have been played more calmly; Gambon could have simply raised a brow and said the line quietly, more like a parent than a scolding headmaster.But some fans still adore \"Grumbledore\" – the angrier version of Dumbledore we saw in the movies. They appreciate that the cinematic version was more transparent about his feelings, a foreshadowing of the dark days ahead. An argument against that point is how important that lack of transparency was in the books. Harry and Dumbledore begin to have trust issues because Dumbledore has that \"poker face,\" something Harry resents in the later installments.One thing that most fans agree on is that Gambon had a perfect look for the character, even if the characterization was off.Emma Watson as Hermione GrangerOne of the most beloved actor-character combinations of the 20th century, Watson's career took off because of her important role in the Harry Potter franchise. However, some fans feel her interpretation was \"wooden and awkward.\" But when her poor acting started?Some fans think she began slowly, but as her acting skills grew, her wooden interpretation fell by the wayside. For others, Watson's fame took away from the character in the later movies. She stopped playing Hermione Granger and began playing Emma Watson, who had quickly become a massive teenage star. In any case, we have to admit that her \"stage persona\" in the latest movies has strayed too far from the scene on the train in the first film and a performance that was \"100% Hermione.\" Alan Rickman as Severus SnapeThe late Alan Rickman's performance was beloved by many, and some consider him their favorite actor in the franchise. Yet, we have to admit some of his faults.Of course, we don't blame Rickman's acting, we blame the script and direction. His character in the books was crueler and therefore more interesting. The way he bullied students was taken as comedy in the films, whereas that was not the intention in the books. Also, for some fans, Rickman's performance is underwhelming simply because he is not how they imagined Snape from the books, who was written as a man in his 30s.Each of the characters took a slightly different spin from J.K. Rowling's original books. Some of these changes are more acceptable to fans than others, and most of the \"poor acting\" by the cast is blamed more on the producers. This argument shows once again that passionate fans of source material novels do not like when their favorite characters are changed in film.Whatever happens next, we love Henry anyway.","topImage":"https://startefacts.com/upload//upload/news/942213088325.jpg","date":"","author":"","description":"A decade after the Harry Potter series ended, discussions about it are still going strong.

Filming and promoting the blockbuster films meant that they were constantly thrust in close proximity to one another. Unlike their beloved characters, the pair always got along very well and had a familial type relationship with one another. Throughout the 10 years, they made lots of memories together. And on the last official day of filming, they shared a moment that was both literally, and figuratively, sweet.It’s no secret that emotions were high on the last day of filming the Harry Potter movies. Potterheads who’ve seen behind-the-scenes footage of Daniel Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint’s last scene know this all too well. The trio was all moved to tears after “cut” was yelled for the final time. But there were also moments of joy and levity on the last day of filming. In fact, Grint decided to celebrate by treating the cast and crew to ice cream.But Grint didn’t just bring a few gallons of ice cream to set. He instead brought his own personal ice cream truck. While on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Watson revealed that her fellow co-star was an ice cream truck owner. “Rupert bought an ice cream truck,” she said. “I’m not even kidding. He actually said to me, he was just being quite serious, he said, ‘If I hadn’t become an actor, I seriously would have considered being an ice cream man.’ I was like, ‘Okay, cool, well.’ So he’s kind of like fulfilled both dreams, you know? It’s not just like he’s bought the truck to kind of drive around, kind of for show. It actually has all of the ice cream in it. All of like the little chocolate drops and everything. It’s amazing.”Grint’s two dreams collided on the final day of shooting. While speaking with Collider, Grint revealed that he brought his fully stocked truck to the Harry Potter set. “I brought it to the last day of filming,” he shared. Continuing on, the Servant actor shared that he and Watson passed out the sweet treats to the cast and crew. “Yeah, me and Emma both were serving,” he explained. “Yeah, it was really good.”\n\t\t\n\t\t\tEmma Watson Was ‘Hanging in Rags’ When She Finished the ‘Harry Potter’ Movies\t\t\n\tBringing his ice cream truck to the set was a great treat. Especially since Grint had to stop taking the van out frequently due to demand. “I don’t very often anymore, ’cause I’ve found that when I take it out, I form queues of people wanting ice cream,” Grint admitted. “It’s quite a tricky thing.” It’s certainly sweet that Grint wanted to treat those on the Harry Potter set to ice cream. And it’s no surprise that Watson stepped in to help him serve it up. After all, Watson hosted a dinner party for the cast at her home near the end of filming. It certainly seems like food was a great way for the creatives to celebrate everything they’d accomplished.","topImage":"https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Harry-Potter-stars-Rupert-Grint-and-Emma-Watson.jpg?w=1200","date":"2022-12-12T18:17:03+00:00","author":"Abeni Tinubu","description":"The last day of filming the 'Harry Potter' movies was emotional.

Rowling Controversy","text":"Harry Melling, best known for playing Dudley Dursley in the Harry Potter films, joins the conversation regarding J.K. Rowling's anti-trans comments.Harry Melling, who played Dudley Dursley in the Harry Potter films, takes a stance on the ongoing J.K. Rowling controversy. Based on Rowling's fantasy books of the same name, the Harry Potter film franchise began with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in 2001. The Harry Potter series, which also includes three Fantastic Beasts films so far, is currently the fourth highest-grossing film franchise of all-time. While she is revered for her writing, Rowling began to spark criticism as early as 2018 for her transphobic commentary, and has continued to perpetuate harmful discourse against the transgender community. As a result, she has become a controversial figure online.In a recent interview with The Independent, Melling weighs in on Rowling's controversy, disagreeing with her anti-trans stance while not condemning the author. Melling says that he believes every person has the right to choose to identify themselves however they'd like, and that \"transgender women are women and transgender men are men.\" Read Melling's statement below:“I can only speak for myself, and what I feel, to me, is very simple, which is that transgender women are women and transgender men are men. Every single person has the right to choose who they are and to identify themselves as what’s true to themselves. I don’t want to join the debate of pointing fingers and saying, ‘That’s right, that’s wrong,’ because I don’t think I’m the correct spokesperson for that. But I do believe that everybody has the right to choose.”Related: JK Rowling Anti-Trans Controversy Explained: What The Harry Potter Author SaidMelling is far from the first Harry Potter cast member to openly disagree with Rowling's viewpoint. In June 2020, Harry Potter lead Daniel Radcliffe released a statement apologizing for Rowling's transphobic comments, saying that he was sorry for the pain that the author's dialogue has caused. He went on to say that \"Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people.\" Radcliffe added that if fans have identified with any Harry Potter characters they consider to be LGBTQ+, they should be free and feel safe to do so. Other Harry Potter stars who took a stance opposite Rowling include Emma Watson and Eddie Redmayne.On the opposite side, some Harry Potter actors have sided with Rowling, many of whom say that the backlash Rowling has received is too harsh. Most recently, Bellatrix Lestrange actor Helena Bonham Carter said that the response to Rowling's comments has been \"horrendous,\" and that Rowling is \"allowed her opinion.\" Voldemort actor Ralph Fiennes made a similar comment in October, saying that the abuse she has been receiving is \"disgusting\" and \"appalling.\"While some actors from the Wizarding World have been vocal on one side of the argument or the other, some have chosen to stay silent on the matter. Melling's comment is unique, however, in that he declines to get involved with the debate not because he doesn't want to cause drama with Rowling, but because as a cisgender, male actor, he acknowledges that he isn't the \"correct spokesperson\" for transgender issues. With Rowling continuing to make her transphobic opinions known, however, there may be more outspoken Harry Potter actors coming forward to weigh in on the issue in the future.Next: Harry Potter: Why Dudley Was Almost Recast After Order of the PhoenixSource: The IndependentSarah Laudenbach (she/her) is a movie and TV news writer for Screen Rant.

Never a plasterer or something, is it?The 31-year-old American - who recently announced she is pregnant - fought off competition from some of the most recognisable faces in Hollywood to land the top spot.It's highly unlikely you'll recognise the entire top 100; however, there are some very big names in there.Coming in at 12th was former Miss Israel and Wonder Woman actor Gal Gadot, who's featured in the list for the 12th time.Ana de Armas - who recently portrayed Marilyn Monroe in Blonde - was ranked 27th on her ninth year on the list.Singer Dua Lipa was a new entry at 56, while Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney was also a new entry at 60th.Emma Watson was placed at 65 in her 17th year on the list - which is slightly eyebrow-raising, given she is 32.Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke came 83rd in her 12th year in the list and Ariana Grande came 85th on her 7th year on the list.And in the nineties, Croatian footballer Ana Maria Markovic was a new entry at 94, followed by Margot Robbie in 96th - on her 8th year on the list - and newcomer Jenna Ortega, who was placed at 97.Of course, as the saying goes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you're probably all wondering why your wife/Jodie Comer hasn't made the list.Explaining how it works, Candler wrote: \"Unlike most other annual beauty rankings, the 100 Most Beautiful Faces List is not a popularity contest and it is definitely not country specific. It is not about the hottest or the most famous celebrity. Rather, the list attempts to inform & broaden public opinion, instead of reflecting it.\"The list introduces new faces to countries they ordinarily would not reach. The Independent Critics search far and wide, listening to the many millions of suggestions submitted by the public over the past couple of decades, and they then put together a list representative of the modern ideal of worldwide beauty.\"The post continued: \"Aesthetic perfection is only one of the criteria. Grace, elegance, originality, daring, passion, class, poise, joy, promise, hope… they are all embodied in a beautiful face.\"WE select only 100 faces out of the approximately 160,000 celebrities (which works out to less than 0.001%). It is a thankless task, as no individual will ever agree with all the choices.\"Over 50 countries are represented on the annual list.

Although some may still complaint about Emma Watson, let's be honest: she is the perfect Hermione. Most likely because that's who Watson is in real life. But in a very heated thread on Reddit Harry Potter fans discuss who of the actors were totally miscast. And there's one character who turns up in comments quite often: Viktor Krum, the Seeker for the Bulgarian Quidditch team.To start with, a seeker is the lightest and fastest flier on the team, who needs both a sharp eye and the ability to fly one- or no-handed. And now try to recall Viktor Krum, the character portrayed by Stanislav Ianevsky, a Bulgarian actor, sporting an athletic body of a bodybuilder.Stanislav was discovered by the Harry Potter casting director Fiona Weir. Ianevsky had no acting background, and before any auditions could take place he had to attend acting classes.The fans argue that in the books Krum didn't seem like an international caliber athlete or someone the girls would be swooning over but we ended up with a bodybuilder actor. The vibe the producers went for was too harsh and they made him seem just all brute force. And looking back, Ianevsky's Krum does look way too old for 17 or 18 years old.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Plot Hole Nobody Explained in YearsOne of the fans mentioned how the funniest part is that Igor Karkaroff's assistant (a film-only character) is a lanky dude with long greasy hair, thick dark eyebrows, and a hooked nose. In other words, he looks just like Viktor Krum looks in the books. And this very actor had actually auditioned to play Krum, but the Harry Potter production team said he didn't look like the character at all.Apart from the fact that the actor was totally miscast, fans say that it is strange that Viktor and Hermione had an affair in first place. Krum was 18, basically, an adult while Hermione was only 14 years old, which makes their \"friendship\" a bit weird. He totally would get arrested should it happen in real life.No, Harry Potter Fandom, You Can't \"Fix\" Draco MalfoyAs for the rest of the lead cast, it was a teenage Tom Riddle, Ginny and young Lily who came under Harry Potter fans' fire as being miscast. It seems that there's no pleasing the fans no matter how hard you try.Whatever happens next, we love Henry anyway.","topImage":"https://startefacts.com/upload//upload/news/695985766641.jpg","date":"","author":"","description":"The iconic trio, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), seems to be the perfect choice for the roles in the Harry Potter franchise.&nbsp;\r\n","keywords":""}]
