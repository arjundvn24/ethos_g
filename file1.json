        "title": "Fear of truth, fear of escalation: China has assessed Modi correctly",
        "text": "As China\u2019s army was inflicting defeats on Indian forces on the disputed border in November 1962, Parliament had been convened to discuss the conflict and bilateral relations. L M Singhvi, an independent MP from Jodhpur who would later join the BJP, backed by some Opposition MPs, requested that it should be a secret session of Lok Sabha as they were to discuss a \u201csensitive\u201d matter. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru rejected the idea.\u201cI gave careful consideration to it. I think that, at the present moment, it would not be desirable to have a secret session,\u201d Nehru replied. \u201cThe issues before the House are of high interest to the whole country. Right at the beginning to ask for a secret session would have a bad effect on the country.\u201d He then went on to personally answer all the questions raised about India\u2019s China policy and the ongoing conflict.In contrast to Nehru, Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP have gone one step ahead of Singhvi in keeping under wraps what\u2019s going on in the border crisis with China. In the past 32 months, since the Chinese ingresses into Ladakh came to light, the government has refused to discuss the matter altogether, not even in an \u2018in camera\u2019 session. Leave alone a debate or discussion in the House, it has not allowed any questions on the subject in Parliament to be accepted for answers. The mention of border clashes has been restricted to a few perfunctory statements by the Defence Minister.In late 2020, then Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha Venkaiah Naidu had asked the government to brief Opposition leaders in private, but that was never done. After the infamous all-party meeting in June 2020 where PM Modi claimed that no Chinese had entered our territory \u2013 essentially validating the Chinese claim that the Indian soldiers who died in Galwan were on Chinese territory \u2013 there have been no more meetings. Neither have journalists been allowed to report freely from the frontline, as was the case during the 1999 Kargil War.Supporters of the government argue this total clampdown on information is essential to provide it the requisite space for diplomatic negotiations. This argument could hold water for a couple of months after the crisis started but has no meaning after 32 months when India\u2019s negotiating strategy has failed to achieve disengagement in important areas like Depsang and Demchok, or de-escalation in areas where disengagement has taken place. In the 17th round of talks this month, the Chinese side flatly refused to discuss these issues and its foreign ministry has already publicly ruled out any suggestions of a return to status quo as it existed in early 2020. If the Modi government hides behind euphemisms like \u201cfriction points\u201d and cannot acknowledge that China has denied Indian Army control of its territory, what force of argument can it bring during the talks? By now, it is evident that China has successfully exploited the Indian government\u2019s penchant for secrecy as a personal weakness of PM Modi.Beijing first learnt the lesson after the Doklam crisis in 2017, when the Indian Army went into Bhutan to stop the Chinese from constructing a road to Jampheri ridge. It resulted in a 72-day long faceoff, when a similar clampdown on information was applied by the government. As government sources declared a win after both sides announced disengagement, it soon emerged that the Chinese had stepped back by only 150 metres and constructed a military base, helipads, and infrastructure with a permanent deployment there. The Modi government claimed \u201cvictory\u201d while the Chinese got their way. Ladakh would have been similar but in this case, Beijing has refused to give Modi a face-saver to somehow claim an honourable resolution.The government wanted to bury the clash at Tawang, where PLA soldiers reportedly fired rounds in the air, but had to concede the truth after a couple of journalists reported it. That the Chinese have constructed an all-weather road and a military camp 150 metres short of the clash site in 2022 is not easy for the government to explain.This information came out from publicly available satellite imagery put out by an Australian think-tank while other commercially available imagery from HawkEye360 has shown PLA and Indian infrastructure and military deployment all along the LAC. Foreign governments would definitely have far more detailed information available to them. It is often betrayed by foreign diplomats and visiting officials in their private interactions in New Delhi. This nails the claim that a parliamentary debate would make operational details available to the adversary.China has correctly assessed that fear of a military escalation in Delhi holds back any bold Indian moves, diplomatic or military. The Modi government is gripped by a fear of provoking China. MoS for Home Ajay Teni deletes a tweet within minutes of proclaiming that he had met a Tibetan delegation. US officials are told not to mention Chinese aggression on the border in any statement, and New Delhi has stalled any security-centric moves under Quad.The attitude, approach and actions of the Modi government on China give credence to claims that it is hiding something. Instead of defending our borders, it is more intent on defending the strongman image of the Prime Minister. Provided a regular dose of Hindutva nationalism by the ruling party and mainstream media, many Indians believe that India can militarily defeat China. The gulf between image and reality is being packed by propaganda, PR, and fake news.Democracy has been India\u2019s strength, and public opinion should be used smartly by the government during negotiations with China. Hiding the truth only emboldens China, which has seen through the veneer of Modi\u2019s image. A free and frank discussion in Parliament will not tie the hands of a leader who is self-confident and sure of himself. Running away from the truth is not only evasion of democratic accountability but 32 months after the border crisis with China, also a strategic folly.Check out DH's latest videosCheck out DH's latest videosCheck out all newslettersDeccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to subscribeFollow us on Facebook  | Twitter  | Dailymotion  | YouTube  As Covid surge continues, so does misinformationB'luru: Record dip in drunk driving cases in NY revelryStartups set for a strong year despite global\u00a0headwindsMonkeys in Chamundi Hills getting 'smarter'Lula takes office for third term as Brazil presidentWhere to invest in 2023As Covid surge continues, so does misinformationB'luru: Record dip in drunk driving cases in NY revelryStartups set for a strong year despite global\u00a0headwindsMonkeys in Chamundi Hills getting 'smarter'Lula takes office for third term as Brazil presidentWhere to invest in 2023 National  Karnataka  Bengaluru  Sports  Business Multimedia Opinion  Entertainment What lies ins tore for partie sin 2023Collegium and its conundrumsInvesting resolutions to make this yearDH photo galleriesDH PicksLatest storiesTrending newsDownload DH APPServicesOur group sitesDownload DH APP We use cookies to understand how you use our site and to improve user experience.

        "text": "The invasion of Ukraine, compounding the effects of the pandemic, has contributed to the ascent of a giant that defies easy alignment. It could be the decisive force in a changing global system.A Hindu ritual on the banks of the Ganges River in Varanasi, northern India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chosen Varanasi as a core vehicle of his assertion of India as a Hindu nation, raising tensions with Muslims.Credit...Supported bySend any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Roger CohenPhotographs by Mauricio LimaRoger Cohen, the Paris bureau chief, and Mauricio Lima spent almost two weeks in India, traveling between New Delhi, Varanasi and Chennai, to write and photograph this piece.Seated in the domed, red sandstone government building unveiled by the British Raj less than two decades before India threw off imperial rule, S. Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister, needs no reminder of how the tides of history sweep away antiquated systems to usher in the new.Such, he believes, is today\u2019s transformative moment. A \u201cworld order which is still very, very deeply Western,\u201d as he put it in an interview, is being hurried out of existence by the impact of the war in Ukraine, to be replaced by a world of \u201cmulti-alignment\u201d where countries will choose their own \u201cparticular policies and preferences and interests.\u201dCertainly, that is what India has done since the war in Ukraine began on Feb. 24. It has rejected American and European pressure at the United Nations to condemn the Russian invasion, turned Moscow into its largest oil supplier and dismissed the perceived hypocrisy of the West. Far from apologetic, its tone has been unabashed and its self-interest broadly naked.\u201cI would still like to see a more rules-based world,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said. \u201cBut when people start pressing you in the name of a rules-based order to give up, to compromise on what are very deep interests, at that stage I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s important to contest that and, if necessary, to call it out.\u201dIn other words, with its almost 1.4 billion inhabitants, soon to overtake China as the world\u2019s most populous country, India has a need for cheap Russian oil to sustain its 7 percent annual growth and lift millions out of poverty. That need is nonnegotiable. India gobbles up all the Russian oil it requires, even some extra for export. For Mr. Jaishankar, time is up on the mind-set that \u201cEurope\u2019s problems are the world\u2019s problems, but the world\u2019s problems are not Europe\u2019s,\u201d as he put it in June.The Ukraine war, which has provoked moral outrage in the West over Russian atrocities, has caused a different anger elsewhere, one focused on a skewed and outdated global distribution of power. As Western sanctions against Russia have driven up energy, food and fertilizer costs, causing acute economic difficulties in poorer countries, resentment of the United States and Europe has stirred in Asia and Africa.Grinding trench warfare on European soil seems the distant affair of others. Its economic cost feels immediate and palpable.\u201cSince February, Europe has imported six times the fossil fuel energy from Russia that India has done,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said. \u201cSo if a $60,000-per-capita society feels it needs to look after itself, and I accept that as legitimate, they should not expect a $2,000-per-capita society to take a hit.\u201dHere comes Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s India, pursuing its own interests with a new assertiveness, throwing off any sense of inferiority and rejecting unalloyed alignment with the West. But which India will strut the 21st-century global stage, and how will its influence be felt?The country is at a crossroads, poised between the vibrant plurality of its democracy since independence in 1947 and a turn toward illiberalism under Mr. Modi. His \u201cHindu Renaissance\u201d has threatened some of the core pillars of India\u2019s democracy: equal treatment of all citizens, the right to dissent, the independence of courts and the media.Democracy and debate are still vigorous \u2014 Mr. Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party lost a municipal election in Delhi this month \u2014 and the prime minister\u2019s popularity remains strong. For many, India is just too vast and various ever to succumb to some unitary nationalist diktat.The postwar order had no place for India at the top table. But now, at a moment when Russia\u2019s military aggression under President Vladimir V. Putin has provided a vivid illustration of how a world of strongmen and imperial rivalry would look, India may have the power to tilt the balance toward an order dominated by democratic pluralism or by repressive leaders.Which way Mr. Modi\u2019s form of nationalism will lean remains to be seen. It has given many Indians a new pride and bolstered the country\u2019s international stature, even as it has weakened the country\u2019s pluralist and secularist model.India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, himself a mixture of East and West through education and upbringing, described the country as \u201csome ancient palimpsest on which layer upon layer of thought and reverie had been inscribed\u201d without any of those layers being effaced.He was convinced that a secular India had to accommodate all the diversity that repeated invasion had bequeathed. Not least, that meant conciliation with the country\u2019s large Muslim minority, now about 200 million people.Today, however, Mr. Nehru is generally reviled by Mr. Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist party. There are no Muslims in Mr. Modi\u2019s cabinet. Hindu mob attacks on Muslims have been met with silence by the prime minister.\u201cHatred has penetrated into society at a level that is absolutely terrifying,\u201d the acclaimed Indian novelist Arundhati Roy said.That may be, but for now, Mr. Modi\u2019s India seems to brim with confidence.The Ukraine war, compounding the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, has fueled the country\u2019s ascent. Together they have pushed corporations to make global supply chains less risky by diversifying toward an open India and away from China\u2019s surveillance state. They have accentuated global economic turbulence from which India is relatively insulated by its huge domestic market.Those factors have contributed to buoyant projections that India, now No. 5, will be the world\u2019s third-largest economy by 2030, behind only the United States and China.On a recent visit to India, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the United States wanted to \u201cdiversify away from countries that present geopolitical and security risks to our supply chain,\u201d singling out India as among \u201ctrusted trading partners.\u201dNonetheless, India is in no mood to cut ties with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia, which supported the country with weapons over decades of nonalignment, while the United States cosseted India\u2019s archenemy, Pakistan. Even in a country starkly fractured over Mr. Modi\u2019s policies, this approach has had near universal backing.\u201cFor many years, the United States did not stand by us, but Moscow has,\u201d Amitabh Kant, who is responsible for India\u2019s presidency of the Group of 20 that began this month, said in an interview. New Delhi has enough rivals, he said: \u201cTry, on top of China and Pakistan, putting Russia against you!\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s India will not do that in an emergent world characterized by Mr. Jaishankar as \u201cmore fragmented, more tense, more on the edge and more under stress\u201d as the war in Ukraine festers.\u201cParadoxically, the war in Ukraine has diminished trust in Western powers and concentrated people\u2019s minds on how to hedge bets,\u201d said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a prominent Indian political theorist. \u201cIndia feels it has the United States figured out: Yes, you will be upset but you\u2019re in no position to do anything about it.\u201dThat has proved a good bet up to now. \u201cThe age of India\u2019s significant global stature has just begun,\u201d said Preeti Dawra, the Indian-born director of global marketing at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.Arriving in Varanasi, Hinduism\u2019s holiest city, in 1896, Mark Twain remarked on the \u201cbewildering and beautiful confusion of stone platforms, temples, stair-flights, rich and stately palaces\u201d rising on the bluff above the Ganges, the river of life.Mr. Modi, 72, who adopted the city as his political constituency in 2014 when he embarked on his campaign to lead India, saying he had been \u201ccalled by the mother Ganges,\u201d has cut a pinkish sandstone gash through this sacred jumble of devotion.Known as \u201cthe corridor\u201d and opened a year ago, the project connects the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, to the riverfront a quarter-mile away.The broad and almost eerily spotless pedestrian expanse, with its museum and other tourist facilities, links the city\u2019s most revered temple to the river where Hindus wash away their sins. It is quintessential Modi.Cut through a labyrinth of more than 300 homes that were destroyed to make way for it, the passage intertwines the prime minister\u2019s political life with the deepest of Hindu traditions. At the same time, it proclaims his readiness to fast-forward India through bold initiatives that break with chaos and decay. Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist and tech enthusiast, is a disrupter.A self-made man from a humble background in the western state of Gujarat, and from a low status in India\u2019s caste system, or social hierarchy, Mr. Modi has come to embody an aspirational India.Through what Srinath Raghavan, a historian, called \u201can incorruptible aura and a genius at orchestrating public narratives,\u201d he appears to have imbued India with the confidence to forge the singular path so evident over the 10 months since Russia went to war.\u201cModi\u2019s social mobility is in some ways the promise of India today,\u201d Mr. Raghavan said in an interview.Afghan.ChinaPakistanNepalDelhiGanges R.VaranasiIndiaMumbaiChennaiArabianSeaBay of BengalSri Lanka400 milesBy The New York TimesThat Modi-inspired promise, as invigorating to the traditionally lower castes of Hindu society as it is troubling to the Brahmins who long ran India, has come at a price.Vishwambhar Nath Mishra, a Hindu religious leader in Varanasi and an engineering professor, said that the corridor had been a \u201cblunder\u201d that had destroyed 142 old shrines, an example of the bulldozing style Mr. Modi favors.\u201cWe have always been a unique family in Varanasi, Muslims and Christians and Hindus who sit down and work things out, but Mr. Modi chooses to create tensions to get elected,\u201d Mr. Mishra said. \u201cIf he is trying to establish a Hindu nation, that is very dangerous.\u201dEvery morning, Mr. Mishra bathes in the Ganges. He heads a foundation that monitors the river and showed me a chart illustrating that the level of fecal matter in it is still dangerously high. So why does he do it? He smiled. \u201cThe Ganges is the medium of our life.\u201dOne recent evening, I watched the Hindu prayer ceremony on the riverfront from a small boat. Perhaps two thousand people had gathered. Candles flickered. Chants rose. Along the great crescent sweep of the river, smoke billowed from the pyres that burn night and day. For a Hindu to die and be cremated in Varanasi is to be assured of transcendence and liberation.A distracting electronic screen flashed behind the ceremony. On it, Mr. Modi\u2019s bearded face appeared at regular intervals, promoting the Indian presidency of the Group of 20 largest global economies, an organization that calls itself the \u201cpremier forum for international economic cooperation.\u201dMr. Modi, as this elaborate choreography of the spiritual and the political suggested, wants to turn India\u2019s presidency of the G20 in 2023 into a premier platform for his bid for re-election, to a third term, in 2024.\u201cBig responsibility, bigger ambitions,\u201d proclaimed one slogan on the screen. G20-related meetings are planned in every Indian state over the next year, including one in Varanasi in August.India wants its presidency of the group to have the world as \u201cone family\u201d and the need for \u201csustainable growth\u201d as its core themes. It wants to push the transformation of developing countries through what Mr. Kant, the organizer, called \u201ctechnological leapfrogging.\u201d India, with its near universal connectivity, sees itself as an example.About 1.3 billion Indians now have a digital identity. Access to all banking activities online, through digital bank accounts, has become commonplace during Mr. Modi\u2019s eight years in power. They were once the preserve of the middle class. Poorer Indians have been empowered.\u201cNobody wants the current world order,\u201d Mr. Kant said. \u201cThere are still two billion people in the world with no bank account.\u201d India will advocate on behalf of poorer nations. But the issue with Mr. Modi\u2019s \u201cone family\u201d theme is that, just up the road from the riverside prayers, his divisiveness is evident.It is not easy to get into the complex, at the top of Mr. Modi\u2019s new corridor, where the 17th-century white-domed Gyanvapi Mosque abuts the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Intense security checks take a long time to negotiate because this is an epicenter of the inflamed Hindu-Muslim tension in India.Armed guards are everywhere. They stand beside the mosque, which is encased behind a 20-foot metal fence topped with coils of razor wire. They patrol the Hindu crowds, who line up in saffron-color robes beside the temple to make their offerings of milk, sometimes mixed with honey, to the simple stone lingam that is the symbol of Shiva.The only mammals that cross easily from the Hindu to Muslim worlds, as if to mock the stubborn divisions of humankind, are the lithe gray monkeys that scamper over barriers from shikhara to minaret.A flurry of legal cases now centers on the mosque. A court survey this year claimed to have uncovered an ancient lingam on the premises of the mosque, so establishing, at least for hard-line Hindus, that they should be allowed to pray there. Large Muslim prayer gatherings have been banned.In the ascendant Hindu narrative that Mr. Modi has done nothing to discourage, India belongs in the first place to its Hindu majority. The Muslim interlopers of the Mughal Empire and other periods of conquest take second place. Mosque must yield to temple if it can be demonstrated that a temple predated it.If Mr. Putin has chosen to portray Ukraine as a birthplace of the Russian world inseparable from the motherland and embraced the Orthodox Church as a bastion of his power, Mr. Modi has chosen Varanasi as a core vehicle of his assertion of India as essentially a Hindu nation. Of course, the Indian leader did so in the interest of power consolidation, not conquest.Three decades ago, the razing by a Hindu mob of a 16th-century mosque in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya, which Hindus believe is the birthplace of the god Ram, led to the death of 2,000 people and propelled the rise of Mr. Modi\u2019s party.A temple is now being built there. Mr. Modi, who presided over the groundbreaking in 2020, has called it \u201cthe modern symbol of our traditions.\u201dFaced by such moves, Ms. Roy, the novelist, voiced a common concern. \u201cYou know, the Varanasi sari, worn by Hindus, woven by Muslims, was a symbol of everything that was so interwoven and is now being ripped apart,\u201d she said. \u201cA threat of violence hangs over the city.\u201dI found Syed Mohammed Yaseen, a leader of the Varanasi Muslim community, which makes up close to a third of the city\u2019s population of roughly 1.2 million, at his timber store. \u201cThe situation is not good,\u201d Mr. Yaseen, 75, said. \u201cWe are dealing with 18 lawsuits relating to the old mosque. The Hindus want to demolish it indirectly by starting their own worship there.\u201d Increasingly, he said, Muslims felt like second-class citizens.\u201cEvery day, we are feeling all kinds of attacks, and our identity is being diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cIndia\u2019s secular character is being dented. It still exists in our Constitution, but in practice, it is dented, and the government is silent.\u201dThis denting has taken several forms under Mr. Modi. Shashi Tharoor, a leading member of the opposition Congress Party that ruled India for most of the time since independence, suggested to me that \u201cinstitutionalized bigotry\u201d had taken hold.A number of lynchings and demolitions of Muslim homes, the imprisonment of Muslim and other journalists critical of Mr. Modi, and the emasculation of independent courts have fanned fears of what Mr. Raghavan, the historian, called \u201ca truly discriminatory regime, with its risk of radicalization.\u201dAs I spoke to Mr. Yaseen, I noticed a man with an automatic rifle seated a few yards to his left. Clearly a Hindu, with a tilak in the middle of his forehead, he took some interest in the conversation.Who, I asked, is this man with a rifle?\u201cHe is my guard, appointed a couple of months ago by the district administration to protect me, given the tension over the mosque,\u201d Mr. Yaseen said.The guard was a police officer named Anurag Mishra. I asked him how he felt about his job. \u201cI am standing here to protect a fellow human being,\u201d he said. \u201cMy religion does not really matter. Nor does his. My superiors told me to do the job.\u201dMr. Yaseen said that he was happy to have a Hindu protecting him, even if \u201cI trust in God, not in the guard.\u201dThat one Indian citizen protects another \u2014 a Hindu police officer with a rifle safeguarding a Muslim community leader from potential Hindu attack \u2014 was at once reassuring, in that it suggested secular, democratic, pluralistic India would not go quietly; and alarming, in that it was necessary at all.At the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November, Indian diplomacy played an important role in finding compromise language after several Western countries had pressed for harsh criticism of Russia over Ukraine or even for Moscow\u2019s ouster from the forum. The phrase, \u201cToday\u2019s era must not be of war,\u201d in the leaders\u2019 declaration, and the reference to \u201cdiplomacy and dialogue,\u201d were a reprise of Mr. Modi\u2019s words to Mr. Putin in September.Could India, with its ties to Russia, mediate a cease-fire in Ukraine, or even a peace settlement? Mr. Jaishankar, the foreign minister, was skeptical. \u201cThe parties involved have to reach a certain situation and a certain mind-set,\u201d he said.And when will the war end? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even hazard an opinion,\u201d he said.Still, India wants to be a bridge power in the world birthed by the pandemic and by the war in Ukraine.It believes that the interconnectedness of today\u2019s world outweighs the pull of fragmentation and makes a nonsense of talk of a renewed Cold War. If a period of disorder seems inevitable as Western power declines, it will most likely be tempered by economic interdependence, the Indian argument goes.With inequality worsening, food security worsening, energy security worsening, and climate change accelerating, more countries are asking what answers the post-1945 Western-dominated order can provide. India, it seems, believes it can be a broker, bridging East-West and North-South divisions.\u201cI would argue that generally in the history of India, India has had a much more peaceful, productive relationship with the world than, for example, Europe has had,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said. \u201cEurope has been very expansionist, which is why we had the period of imperialism and colonialism. But in India, despite being subjected to colonialism for two centuries, there\u2019s no animus against the world, no anger. It is a very open society.\u201dIt is also situated between two hostile powers, Pakistan and China.In December, there was another skirmish at the 2,100-mile disputed Chinese-Indian border. Nobody was killed, unlike in 2020, when at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died. But tensions remain high. \u201cThe relationship is very fraught,\u201d Mr. Jaishankar said.Escalation at the border is possible at any moment, but it appears unlikely that India can count on Russia, given Moscow\u2019s growing economic and military dependence on China. That makes India\u2019s strategic relationship with the West critical.In the light of the war in Ukraine, however, each party is adjusting to the fact that the other will pick and choose its principles.\u201cUkraine is certainly not seen here as something with a clear moral tale to tell,\u201d Ms. Roy, the novelist, said. \u201cWhen brown or Black people get bombed or shocked-and-awed, it does not matter, but with white people it is supposed to be different.\u201dIndia is in a delicate position. In the face of American criticism, the country chose to take part this year in Russian military exercises that included units from China. At the same time, India is part of a four-nation coalition known as the Quad that includes the United States, Japan and Australia and works for a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific.\u201dThis is Indian multi-alignment at work. The Ukraine war has only reinforced New Delhi\u2019s commitment to this course. Washington has worked hard over many years to make India Asia\u2019s democratic counterbalance to President Xi Jinping\u2019s authoritarian China. But the world, as seen from India, is too complex for such binary options.If the Biden administration has been unhappy with India\u2019s business-as-usual approach to Mr. Putin since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it has also been accepting of it \u2014 American realpolitik, as China rises, demands that Mr. Modi not be alienated.At the end of my stay, I traveled down to Chennai on the southeastern coast.The atmosphere is softer there. The economy is booming. The electronics manufacturer Foxconn is rapidly expanding production capacity for Apple devices, building a hostel for 60,000 workers on a 20-acre site near the city.\u201cThe great mass of Indians are awakening to the fact that they don\u2019t need the ideology of the West and that we can set our own path \u2014 and Modi deserves credit for that,\u201d Venky Naik, a retired businessman, said.I went to a concert where a musician played haunting songs and spoke of \u201crenewing your auspiciousness every day.\u201d There I ran into Mukund Padmanabhan, a former editor of The Hindu newspaper and now a professor of public practice at the newly established Krea University, north of Chennai.\u201cI do not believe Modi can marshal Hinduism into a monolithic nationalist force,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are thousands of Gods, and you don\u2019t have to believe in any of them. There is no single or unique way.\u201dHe gestured toward the mixed crowd of Hindus and Muslims at the concert. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to talk about the project of Gandhi and Nehru, which was to bring everyone along and go forward, but it happened, and it is part of our truth, part of the indelible Indian palimpsest.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement",

        "text": "The year 2022 ended on a note of personal loss for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who performed the last rites of his mother on December 31. BJP chief ministers, Union ministers, party leaders and sections of the media extolled the PM as a true karmayogi who \"returned to the service of the people just two hours\" after cremating his mother.In 2022, the BJP credited its electoral wins, particularly in UP in March, and in Gujarat in December, to the PM's talismanic leadership, adding to his mystique. The year 2023 could be more challenging, given the tough elections in Tripura and Karnataka in the first half of the year. However, the BJP is sure to head into these elections showcasing Modi's leadership rather than that of its respective chief ministers.But even in the absence of electoral wins, India will host international events that are likely to be vehicles to burnish the PM's credentials as one of the tallest world leaders. India is the current president of the G20 and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) groupings, and will host the two summits by September. The PM playing the host to the most powerful leaders in the world would be used to increase his stature in the public perception in the run-up to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The inauguration of the new Parliament building before the Budget session will be another event to highlight the PM's leadership.Also Read:\u00a0BJP leaders praise 'karmayogi' Modi for continuing with official engagements despite personal grief The 2024 elections are already being presented as a done deal. As Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said on the last day of the year, whoever might lead the opposition, Modi will be the PM in 2024. But with the Centre doing away with the post-Covid PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, subsuming it in the National Food Security Act, but effectively halving the subsidy amid food inflation that remains a concern, the Union Budget would be keenly watched for its welfarism. It would be the last full budget of the current government before the General Elections.In 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi benchmarked the year 2022 - the 75th year of India's independence - that will scale peaks once thought unattainable. He had promised the 'new India' by 2022 would become a $5 trillion economy, housing for all, tap water for all homes and doubling farmers' income. The failure to achieve these has now been attributed to two Covid years. But there are new benchmarks for 2023.Also Read:\u00a0Analysis: 2023 promises to be a political humdingerFor example, on new year's day, Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the PM's vision for 2023 is to have mobile phone exports with the segment featuring in the top 10 export category from India. The government announced on Sunday that it has lined up a series of millet-centric promotional activities across the country as the International Year of Millets (IYM) kicks in and the PM's vision is to make IYM 2023 a \"people's movement\" alongside positioning India as the \"global hub of millets.\"Union Home Minister Amit Shah credited the PM for redeveloping Kashi, Kedarnath, Badrinath, and Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The PM's visits to some of these shrines, including Assam's Kamakhya temple, which is also undergoing redevelopment, and Ayodhya where the temple could be inaugurated before 2024 polls, are likely in the coming months. But as the BJP's Himachal loss showed, if upset about their livelihood issues and presented with a credible alternative, no charisma can prevent people from booting out a government.Check out DH's latest videosCheck out DH's latest videosCheck out all newslettersDeccan Herald News now on Telegram - Click here to subscribeFollow us on Facebook  | Twitter  | Dailymotion  | YouTube  Special 'diet plan' for Jallikattu bulls to fight wellBiryani, chips, even khichdi!

The mortal remains of 426 Pakistani Hindus will be immersed in the river Ganges in Haridwar after Prime Minister Narendra Modi amended the sponsorship policy.The last rites of these people were performed in Pakistan. Their mortal remains are currently kept in Hindu temples and crematoriums in Karachi. According to Hindu beliefs, if the ashes of a deceased are immersed in the Ganges at Haridwar, their soul reaches heaven and escapes the cycle of rebirth.The Indian government led by PM Modi does not allow entry of Pakistani Hindu pilgrims without any sponsor from India.According to a report by The Express Tribune, the Indian government has indicated that the family members of the deceased Hindu will be given a 10-day visa to India to immerse their ashes. Between 2011 and 2016, the ashes of 295 Hindus were sent to the Wagah border between India and Pakistan.This will be the first time that a member of a Pakistani Hindu family will himself carry the ashes to Haridwar. Pakistan\u2019s media has \u2018appreciated\u2019 this step. Trade between India and Pakistan is closed since 2019. Relations between the two often remain tense. In such a situation, it is almost \u2018impossible\u2019 for citizens to get a visa for another country.Karachi\u2019s Soldier Bazaar and Ranchhor Lines have a sizeable Hindu community who have been living here since long before Partition. Their population is estimated to be between 100,000 and 150,000.About five lakh Hindus live in Kunri, Nagarparkar and Islamkot in Tharparkar district. Pakistani Hindus used to cremate their dead and keep the ashes in temples or cremation grounds in the hope that one day they would be able to immerse them in the river Ganges.As per the policy of the Government of India, visa for a family member to take the ashes to Haridwar can be issued only if a family member from India or an acquaintance settled there sponsors them. Most Pakistani Hindus do not have relatives in India. Bones of 300 Hindus are kept in the Ossuary Palace at Sonpuri cremation ground near Old Golimar in Karachi.

        "title": "6 Reasons Why Narendra Modi Should Consider Contesting From Ramanathapuram - The Commune",
        "text": "Mainstreaming AlternateSpeculations galore that Prime Minister Narendra Modi might stand in Ramanathapuram Lok Sabha constituency in 2024 Lok Sabha elections. An article in Sunday Guardian mooted this idea and social media is abuzz with this idea ever since then.The writer of this piece had in the past mooted the idea of PM Modi standing in a seat from Tamil Nadu and even suggested the constituency of Madurai, the Eternal City and the seat of Tamil Sangams and where Lord Shiva played his divine Tiruvilaiyadal multiple times.Amidst this backdrop, Narendra Modi contesting from Ramanathapuram in 2024 could be hitting many mangoes with a single stone, a multi-utility move which can serve a variety of purposes. Let us look at the purposes one by one below.1. Fostering North-South UnityNarendra Modi is a sitting member from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat. Varanasi is one of the holiest cities for Hindus. A Hindu life is incomplete without a pilgrimage to Varanasi and any pilgrimage to Varanasi is incomplete without a visit to Rameshwaram and performing the rites for our ancestors. This Kashi-Rameshwaram bond is one of those invisible bonds or threads across Hindus in India binding them together despite all regional and linguistic differences. A bond which fosters Unity in Diversity for Indians. Modi standing in Ramanathapuram Lok Sabha seat in 2024 alongside Varanasi will foster this unity further and put an end to secessionist forces who whip up passions furthering North-South divide. If he contests from Ramnad, it will further fortify the goodwill created by the recent Kashi Tamil Sangamam and help create a Sangaman of North and South minds.2. Perception ChangeDetractors of Modi in Tamil Nadu portrayed Modi as the villain of Tamils post the death of AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa in 2016 and managed to create a maya that Modi is anti-Tamil, anti-South and held him responsible for all the ills plaguing the state of Tamil Nadu. This anti-Modi feeling was prevalent in 2019 and his detractors primarily anti-national forces portrayed him as someone who ran away breaking the compound wall of IIT-M. This wave soon fizzled out and his words in a public meeting in Madurai \u201cNarendra and Devendra\u201d stroked the right chord with the masses in 2021 and enabled NDA win 19 out of 60 Assembly seats in Pandya Nadu region (the region surrounding Madurai) of the state where Ramanathapuram Lok Sabha seat is located.\u00a0Modi contesting from Ramnad in 2024 will convey to his detractors that he is taking their challenge head on and this move of his will generate a pro-Modi wave in Tamil Nadu which can help NDA sweep in 2024. Modi has a golden chance to convert a state which was anti-Modi in 2019 to a pro-Modi state in 2024. That would be the real pinnacle of his electoral successes.3. Dravidian FaultlinesRamanathapuram Lok Sabha seat exposes the faultlines of Dravidian polity. The Lok Sabha seat is under developed when compared to a seat in Kongu region or Madras region. It is one of the poorest districts of Tamil Nadu long neglected by Dravidian polity. The Lok Sabha seat supplies hard working migrant labourers to Gulf and South East Asia. Ramnad is a barren and dry district which has not seen industrial development so far. The very fact that the district got its medical college only recently stands to the testimony of its backwardness. The voter\u2019s turnout data of the seat itself will reveal the apathy of lack of development as many males who had gone out to eke out a living abroad working in harsh conditions not able to exercise their franchisee and hence the women voters will outnumber men big time in this seat. Modi will emerge as the beacon of hope for the voters of the constituency and he can expose the Dravidian faultlines of regional imbalance in development and write a new chapter in Tamil Nadu\u2019s polity.4. Unification Of NDALok Sabha results of 2019 in Ramnad reveals all that is wrong with NDA in Tamil Nadu. IUML Candidate fielded by UPA won with 44% votes. The BJP candidate polled 32.2% and the candidate fielded by AMMK, a splinter group of AIADMK led by TTV Dinakaran, polled 13%. A united NDA would have won the seat easily in 2019 itself despite the anti-Modi wave in 2019.\u00a0Modi by standing now can romp home easily securing more than 60% and he standing here could bring all the earring groups of AIADMK together thereby strengthening NDA big time. TTV Dinakaran has already said he is not averse to Modi and O Paneerselvam\u2019s bonhomie with Modi is well known as well. Modi\u2019s candidature will create a conducive atmosphere for warring faction of ADMK to unite as well as enhance BJP\u2019s bargaining power in seat sharing as well. Modi\u2019s candidature will reinvigorate NDA cadres bigtime and enable them a sweep in TN.5. Modi And TamilModi quotes Tamil Literature and great Tamil poets like Bharathiyar, Valluvar and Poongondran with ease wherever he goes. No other PM of India would have extensively quoted Tamil literature and poets as Modi had done in various prestigious global forums. Modi govt\u2019s numerous initiatives like Mudra loans, crop insurance and free food grains under NFSA have benefitted Tamil Nadu big. And not to forget, the numerous national highway schemes and the introduction of new additional trains to Tamil Nadu like Chennai-Madurai Tejas Express, Chennai-Nagercoil Antyodaya Express, broad gauging of Madurai to Bodi line, restoration of Pamban Bridge have also benefitted the state especially the people of South Tamil Nadu. Statistics reveal the attacks on Indian fisherman by Sri Lankan Navy and the casualties associated with such attacks have come down dramatically since Modi took office. Ramnad has a large chunk of these fisher men folk. Modi standing in Ramnad will further make him closer and dearer to the hearts of Tamils.\u00a06. Electoral ChallengeAt a time, when Modi\u2019s opponent is looking for a safe seat i.e., a seat with a demography suited to him, Modi standing from a seat in Tamil Nadu where BJP is considered weak and lacking organisational strength will signal to his detractors that he is not new to electoral challenges and will not run away like his opponents in search of a safe seat. Modi standing in Varanasi in 2014 turned around the fortunes of BJP in Uttar Pradesh and the adjacent Bihar and helped them sweep both the states. Modi standing now in Ramnad can potentially prove to be a point of inflexion for BJP\u2019s fortune in Tamil Nadu, breach the Dravidian citadel and provide the much-needed fillip to the young Annamalai, who is taking on the mighty ecosystem single handedly.\u00a0Modi standing in Ramnad will not only help NDA win a majority of seats in Tamil Nadu but also help BJP catapult from sub 10% vote share in the state to 20% plus vote share and fill the vacuum left behind by the demise of Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa in the state.Indira Gandhi backtracked from contesting in Tanjore Lok Sabha seat in late 70s. A move that could have helped Congress bounce back in the state but she left that golden opportunity go. Modi has a chance to rewrite the electoral history of the state now.
