Joe Bidden,Biden awards Presidential Citizens Medals on two-year anniversary of Jan. 6 Capitol riot,"President Joe Biden on Friday marked the second anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot by awarding one of the nation's highest civilian honors to 14 individuals who showed courage and selflessness during the events surrounding the deadly insurrection.The award ceremony at the White House was Biden's first time bestowing the Presidential Citizens Medal, which is given to Americans ""who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.""The group included law enforcement officers, current and former politicians and election workers who were targeted with threats following the 2020 presidential contest. Three of the medals were awarded posthumously to officers who had defended the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and died afterward by injuries or by suicide.""America owes you all, I really mean this, a debt of gratitude,"" Biden said during impassioned remarks at the Friday afternoon ceremony.The recipients were honored for their actions before, during and after the riot, when a violent mob of former President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, fighting with officers, destroying and stealing property and threatening lawmakers. The attack came shortly after a joint session of Congress convened to confirm Biden's presidential victory over Trump, who had falsely asserted he won the 2020 election.The mob forced lawmakers to flee their chambers for several hours, impeding the transfer of power. More than 100 officers were injured during the attack, and federal officials estimate the insurrection cost millions of dollars in damages.""All of it was fueled by lies about the 2020 election,"" Biden said Friday, without mentioning Trump by name. The former president, who remains a major force in the Republican Party, has already launched a campaign for the White House in 2024.Democracy held after Jan. 6 only because ""we the people did not flinch, we the people endured, we the people prevailed,"" Biden said.Among the honorees was Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who diverted a group of rioters hurtling toward the Senate chamber, which had not yet been fully evacuated. Multiple officers who were injured during the riot — Aquilino Gonell, Michael Fanone, Caroline Edwards and Daniel Hodges — were also given awards, as was Officer Harry Dunn, who testified about facing racial slurs and harassment from the mob.Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and former Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers were honored for resisting pressure from Trump's allies to overturn their states' election results. Bowers, a Republican, lost a state Senate bid in 2022 to an opponent backed by Trump.Biden also awarded Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, two election workers in Fulton County, Georgia, who faced waves of harassment and threats related to unfounded voter-fraud conspiracy theories in the state.Officers Brian Sicknick, Howard Liebengood and Jeffrey Smith were given posthumous awards. Sicknick died a day after grappling with rioters at the Capitol. His manner of death was determined to be natural causes, but Washington Chief Medical Examiner Francisco Diaz said at the time, ""all that transpired played a role in his condition."" Liebengood and Smith both died by suicide after defending the Capitol.Biden's speech marking the anniversary of the riot followed other ceremonies and remembrances on Capitol Hill, mostly from Democratic lawmakers.""Today marks 2 years since a violent mob of insurrectionists — sanctioned by the former President —descended on the Capitol in an armed and deadly effort to halt the peaceful transfer of power and reverse the outcome of a free and fair election,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Friday morning. ""To this day, Donald Trump continues his attempt to poison American democracy with his Big Lie.""In a brief ceremony on the House steps, lawmakers gathered for a moment of silence with the families of officers who died in relation to the riot. Many more were injured or traumatized by the mob, noted Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the new House Democratic leader. ""We stand here today with our democracy intact because of those officers,"" Jeffries said.Only one Republican representative, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, attended that event, according to one report.The anniversary came as House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California continued his fight to become speaker of the House after three straight days of failing to win enough votes from his party. In the days after the Jan. 6 riot, McCarthy initially blamed Trump for the attack, saying the president ""bears responsibility"" even as he opposed Democrats' efforts to impeach Trump for a second time. But McCarthy soon walked back that criticism.The somber event at the White House was punctuated by a few moments of levity. After Biden fumbled the pronunciation of Gonell's name, the former USCP Sergeant corrected him, prompting the president to shake the officer's hand and quip, ""He can call me President Bidden from now on.""In another instance, Biden drew laughter when he acknowledged a technical difficulty causing an echo in his audio.Got a confidential news tip?

Joe Bidden,Biden says it's 'embarrassing' and 'not my problem' the GOP can't agree on a House speaker,"President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that it's a ""little embarrassing"" that House Republicans can't agree on a speaker, adding that the most chaotic leadership battle in a century also casts a pall on the US abroad.""We are finally coming out of the time of the whole history relating to January 6, things are settling out, and now for the first time in 100 years we can't move,"" Biden told reporters before departing for an event touting his bipartisan infrastructure law in Kentucky. ""It's not a good look. It's not a good thing, and I really hope they get their act together.""Biden's comments come as the House of Representatives remains deadlocked over its inability to agree on a Speaker of the House. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who a majority of his caucus put forth in a previous closed-door vote, lost the support of as many as 20 fellow Republicans during three successive votes on Tuesday. Without a speaker, the House cannot perform even the most basic function of swearing in lawmakers, let alone pass legislation.The president added that it's ""not my problem."" Instead, he said he will turn his attention elsewhere while the GOP publicly dukes out its future.""What I'm focused on is getting things done,"" Biden saidLater in the afternoon, Biden joined Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky to tout the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law that is paving the way for an overhaul of the beleaguered Brent Spence Bridge, a major artery that connects Ohio and Kentucky.Biden, speaking at an infrastructure event in Kentucky, noted that Democratic Rep.-elect Greg Landsman of Ohio's 1st District couldn't be there because he was dealing with trying to figure out who will be the next House speaker.""I wish him a lot of luck,"" Biden said with a laugh. ""He may be the first freshman ever elected speaker of the House of Representatives.""Talking with reporters after the event, Biden jokingly offered his congratulations to Reuters' Steve Holland.""They just elected you speaker,"" the president said.Meanwhile, McCarthy's losing streak extended to six votes.

Joe Bidden,Biden tears into 'sick insurrectionists' at January 6 event,"By Nikki Schwab, Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.com   Published:  21:38 GMT, 6 January 2023   |  Updated:  00:15 GMT, 7 January 2023    283View  commentsPresident Joe Biden condemned 'sick insurrectionists' and bestowed high honors on Friday to those who stood up against the January 6 mob two years ago and thwarted efforts to upend 2020 election results in several swing states, declaring 'America is a land of laws, not chaos.''Our democracy held,' Biden said in awarding Presidential Citizens Medals to fourteen recipients from across the country in the White House East Room. 'We the people did not flinch.'The honorees were a who's who of those who testified before the House Select Committee on January 6 including opening witness, Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards, Republican Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, and Georgia poll workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss.  At least nine people who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, died during or after the rioting, including Ashli Babbitt who was shot and killed by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other supporters of then-President Donald Trump who suffered medical emergencies, according to authorities.President Joe Biden tore into the 'sick insurrectionists' as he awarded 14 individuals with the Presidential Citizens Medal at a White House ceremony Friday marking the second anniversary of the January 6 Capitol attackTwo officers, Howard Liebengood of the Capitol Police and Jeffrey Smith of the Metropolitan Police, were at the Capito during the attack and died by suicide in the following days. Biden honored both with posthumous medals.A third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and died after engaging with the protesters. A medical examiner later determined he died of natural causes.'Sick insurrectionists,' Biden said. 'We must say clearly with a united voice that there is no place ... for voter intimidation or election violence.''What you did was truly consequential. Not a joke,' Biden told the awardees, including family members of the fallen officers. 'If I could halt for a second and just say to you the impact of what happened on July the 6th had international repercussions beyond what any of you can understand,' Biden said, messing up the date by six months.      Violent rioters, loyal to President Donald Trump, storm the Capitol in Washington, DC on Jan. 6, 2021. Insurrectionists loyal to President Donald Trump try to break through a police barrier, Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.Biden spoke with frustration about the death of Capitol Police Officer Billy Evans, who was killed in a car attack in April 2021, while the Capitol Building was still heavily fortified in the aftermath of the insurrection. Evans died, Biden said, 'three months after January 6 while they're still cordoning off the Capitol because of the threats of these sick insurrectionists continued to be profligated on the internet.' 'Officer Evans was killed defending the checkpoint you had to go through to get up to the Capitol because of these God-awful sick threats that continued to go forward,' the president continued. 'And the whole world saw it.' The president also got riled up when he spoke about what happened to Freeman and Moss, the mother-and-daughter Atlanta election workers who became targeted by former President Donald Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani for passing a fictional USB drive filled with fake votes to one another. When Moss testified before the January 6 committee in June, she revealed she had given her mother a 'ginger mint.' 'Both of them are just doing their job until they were targeted and threatened by the same predators and peddlers of lies that would fuel the insurrection,' Biden said. 'They were forced from their homes facing despicable racist taunts.' U.S. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards holds up a sheet of paper as she recounts how pale Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick's face was when she saw him on Jan. 6, 2021Washington Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone listens during the House select committee hearing on the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.President Joe Biden shakes hands with U.S. Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell during a ceremony to mark the second anniversary of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol Biden said he had become a 'friend' of former D.C. Metropolitan Police officer Michael Fanone, one of the most outspoken officers about getting people held accountable since the Capitol attack. As he gave an award to Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilino Gonell, Biden butchered his name and then remarked: 'He can call me President Bidden from now on' - a lighthearted moment in what was otherwise a somber occasion. Presenting Metropolitan Police Department Officer Daniel Hodges with his medal, Biden recalled one of the most shocking scenes of the riot - seeing Hodges screaming in agony as he was getting crushed in a Capitol doorway.'His first time inside the Capitol was on January 6 - sprayed with poison, pinned and crushed, eye almost gauged out, but he didn't break,' Biden recalled. 'After it was over, he was asked what he had been fighting for. Just a local guy. An ordinary American and he gave a simple, straightforward answer,' Biden continued. Hodges' answer, the president said, was 'democracy.'   'He wasn't a scholar, he wasn't a historian, he was a red-blooded American fighting for democracy,' Biden said.  When offering condolences to the family of Officer Liebengood the president recalled how he had known the late cop's father, Howard Liebengood Sr., had served as Senate sergeant at arms in the 1980s. 'Howard's dad was a good friend,' Biden said. 'We were genuinely friends.' 'He lost his life after protecting the democratic institutions he learned to revere growing up,' Biden added. The president applauded the families of both Liebengood and Smith for pushing to get laws changed so that officers who experienced traumatic events and then committed suicide would be considered line-of-duty fatalities, allowing their families access to better death benefits. Supporters of former President Donald Trump protest outside of the Supreme Court on the second anniversary of the Jan. 6, assault on the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, D.C.Biden's event was ongoing as news broke that the mother of Babbitt, the MAGA protester who was shot and killed by Capitol police amid the attack, was arrested for demonstrating Friday outside the Supreme Court. A handful of people who were aligned with the MAGA mob marked the two-year anniversary of the Capitol riot with a push for justice for those arrested for participating. While the congressional investigations about Jan. 6 have ended, the criminal cases are still very much continuing, both for the 950 arrested and charged in the violent attack and for Trump and his associates who remain under investigation.

Joe Bidden,"Biden: GOP speaker drama 'embarrassing,' 'not a good look'","President Joe Biden says House Republicans' inability to unify behind a speaker candidate is “embarrassing” and “not a good look” for the countryWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden said House Republicans' inability to unify behind         a speaker candidate, which has prevented the chamber from beginning its legislative business, was “embarrassing” and “not a good look” for the country.Speaking at the White House on Wednesday before         traveling to Kentucky for an event to highlight last year's bipartisan infrastructure law with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Biden said of Republicans, “I hope they get their act together.” Biden said that “the rest of the world is looking” at the chaotic scenes on the House floor but that his focus was on “getting things done.”“That’s not my problem,” the Democratic president said of the speaker vote. “I just think it’s really embarrassing it’s taking so long.” He declined to say whether he had any choice for the speaker job, adding “I have no idea” who will prevail.House Republicans' choice candidate for the job, Kevin McCarthy of California, failed to win the required majority on three ballots on Tuesday — the first time in a century a speaker hasn't been selected on the first ballot. Members-elect were set to return to the chamber on Wednesday for         additional balloting.A speaker is required for the would-be members to be sworn-in and for the chamber's business to begin.24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_d23908b15d514b17a8eba7709b4aa600_16x9_992.jpg,,ABC News,President Joe Biden says House Republicans' inability to unify behind a speaker candidate is “embarrassing” and “not a good look” for the country,"['Politics', ' Voting', ' Kevin McCarthy', ' Mitch McConnell', ' Joe Biden', ' United States House of Representatives', ' United States government', ' District of Columbia']",63b9841319534a5b2679d200
