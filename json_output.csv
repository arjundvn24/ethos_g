Inside the biggest economic mystery of 2023,"Saturday January 07, 2023 Hi, it's Enda. The champagne is barely flat from the weekend's parties, but economists are looking ahead to 2023's surprises. And there is no topic more contested—and crucial—than inflation.More than geopolitics, the question of inflation has taken on a degree of urgency after forecasts through much of last year were shredded as prices raced away and policymakers scrambled to respond. The end result has been a global economy on the brink of recession. Swiss bank UBS has forecast world growth of 2.1% this year, the eighth-weakest year since the late 1960s.One argument gaining traction is that last year's rapid price gains will turn to disinflation, if not outright deflation, sooner than expected as global growth slows and energy and food prices fall. Rising unemployment will keep a lid on wage gains.There's scattered evidence in support of that theory. Turkish inflation in December decelerated at its steepest pace in more than a quarter century. Prices in UK stores dipped in December, marking the first decline in over a year. Both French and German inflation slowed more than anticipated in the same month.In energy markets, natural gas prices are plunging after a warmer than expected start to winter. US benchmark prices dropped as much as 12% on Tuesday to fall below $4 per million British thermal units for the first time since February. West Texas Intermediate oil fell toward $76 a barrel after sinking 4.2% on Tuesday in the biggest drop since November.If these developments hold, it could see forecasts for slower inflation get revised lower—again.Global CPI peaked at 9.8% in the third quarter of last year and is on a path to end this year at 5.3% as growth slows, according to Bloomberg Economics.Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimated in December that inflation will slide substantially this year, even if that decline is incomplete. They expect core inflation in the US and euro zone will fall well short of central bank expectations.Policymakers are signaling slower price gains. Israel's central bank on 1 January raised interest rates to their highest level since 2008 and signaled they'll remain elevated for some time. Yet central bank governor Amir Yaron expects prices to come off in the second half of the year.""We will still see inflation on an annual basis going up in the next two months,"" Yaron said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week. ""But then afterward modestly declining and then even more so declining in the second half of 2023 into the target rate.""Much slower than expected inflation would take the steam out of the most aggressive cycle of interest rate hikes in 40 years, with knock on consequences for consumers, real estate and business confidence, and for views that the world is headed for a deep recession.To be clear, it's too early to call a definitive path for inflation and the direction will vary by economy. Neither have central banks yet reached their comfort zone.In the US, for example, unless there's a major surprise, payrolls data on Friday is expected to show resilience justifying the argument by Fed officials that it's too early to talk of a monetary policy pivot.Skeptics are also warning against calling an end to the inflation cycle. Scion Asset Management founder Michael Burry warned that while inflation has peaked, it's likely to accelerate due to government spending.""The US in recession by any definition,"" Burry, the investor made famous by Christian Bale in the 2015 movie The Big Short, wrote on Twitter late Sunday. ""Fed will cut and government will stimulate. And we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard.""Still, if 2022 offers any lessons it's that inflation can shock—in either direction.Albert Edwards of Societe Generale is among those flagging the risk of a big collapse in headline inflation amid recession risk and falling commodity prices, though he warns that could merely set up a second wave of inflation akin to the 1970s.Others say the transitory crowd may ultimately have their day as powerful structural forces including technology and the enduring impact of globalization will ensure further price gains are slow, according to Stephen Jen, the London-based chief executive of hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital Ltd.""I remain in the camp that believes that global structural inflation will likely remain low,"" Jen said. ""There could be spurts of wage inflation, which is almost necessary to maintain social stability in the developed world. But how could we expect stable wage inflation and PPI deflation in China not to have an impact on inflation in the West?"" —Enda Curran, Bloomberg News, chief Asia economics correspondentOpening Lines

Comptroller slams undefined role of Israeli negotiator for release of Gaza captives,"Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian is The Times of Israel's military correspondent.The job description of Israel’s chief negotiator on behalf of Israelis held by the Gaza-ruling Hamas terror group have never been formally established, the state comptroller warned in a report issued Tuesday.State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman said the negotiators have operated over the years without the Prime Minister’s Office ever actually establishing the responsibilities, authority, or any detailed framework of the role.The last top negotiator, Yaron Blum, announced in October that he was resigning after nearly five years in the post. Before him, Lior Lotan served in the position between 2014 and 2017.According to Englman’s report, the government never implemented recommendations made by the 2012 Shamgar Commission, which set out to determine principles for prisoner releases. A lone security cabinet meeting in June 2014 discussed the recommendations.“The comptroller found that there were no further discussions by the government, the [security] cabinet or any other committee of ministers regarding the Shamgar Committee’s recommendations, and no decisions were made regarding the committee’s recommendations,” the report said.The report said information the PMO had about the negotiator’s work was not handled in an orderly fashion, and the negotiator himself had “minimal” information about his predecessor’s work.Additionally, there was no formal framework for the negotiator’s connection with the families of Israeli captives.A family member of one of the captives told Englman that a meeting she had held with one of the negotiators was “void of content” and he did not present any “significant information” regarding the efforts to return her relative, the report said.Englman also said that the last negotiator was paid a monthly salary of around NIS 50,000 ($14,000) over a four-and-a-half-year period, with work hours similar to state employees, despite him technically being an “external adviser.”According to Civil Service Commission guidelines, external advisers are not allowed to be employed by state agencies for lengthy periods and with similar monthly hours to state employees.Englman recommended that the role of negotiator be officially established and its authority and responsibilities defined.Hamas is holding two Israeli citizens, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, since 2014 and 2015, respectively, along with the remains of IDF soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin, who were killed during a 50-day conflict with the terror group in 2014.Israel and Hamas have held indirect talks in an attempt to reach a prisoner exchange deal. A similar deal that released Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from Hamas captivity saw 1,027 Palestinian security prisoners released, many of them convicted terrorists.Israel has worked to secure the return of two living men and the two soldiers’ remains to their families. Egyptian intelligence, which maintains close ties to both Israel and Hamas, often serves as the key intermediary.Those efforts have so far failed to yield results. In 2021, Israeli defense officials held a round of talks described as the most significant and serious to date in light of the added pressure on Hamas from the coronavirus pandemic, which had been growing steadily in the beleaguered Gaza Strip.Hamas is considered highly unlikely to concede on the matter of the mass release of Palestinian security prisoners, a highly contentious move that no Israeli government is likely to approve again.The 2011 exchange to secure the release of Shalit was deeply controversial, with many in Israel’s security establishment at the time calling it lopsided in Hamas’s favor. Many of the 1,027 prisoners released later returned to terror — such as Yahya Sinwar, who now serves as Hamas’s Gaza governor.Do you rely on The Times of Israel for accurate and insightful news on Israel and the Jewish world?

US likely headed for economic 'soft landing' -White House's Boushey,"Saturday January 07, 2023 The US economy appears headed for a soft landing, with recent economic data pointing to an ongoing recovery, not a recession, White House economist Heather Boushey told Reuters on Friday.Boushey welcomed Friday's datashowing the US economy adding jobs at a solid clip in December, with the unemployment rate dropping to a pre-pandemic low of 3.5%, and said the biggest economic challenge now was persistent tightness in labor supply.Asked whether the United States could avoid a recession, Boushey, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said, ""There are no indications that that is where we are now.""""The steps have been taken and it looks like we are in a very good position to have that soft landing that everyone is talking about,"" she said.A soft landing is the ideal Federal Reserve policy goal after raising interest rates, a situation in which inflation slows but there are not enough job losses to trigger a recession.Other challenges include the impact of the war in Ukraine on energy prices and ongoing COVID-19 risks, especially with China's shifting away from its zero-COVID policy, Boushey said.Boushey said she also worried that challenges finding affordable care for children, the elderly and the disabled were still keeping workers out of the labor force.President Joe Biden had hoped to enact reforms to fund universal preschool and ensure improvements to the ""care economy,"" but failed to win sufficient support in Congress. Prospects have dimmed further given the divided Congress, but Boushey said Biden would continue to push for progress.""We continue to see there is a crisis of care that is holding back labor force participation for both men and women,"" she said, adding that US rates were ""quite low"" relative to other advanced economies.""It is an important issue,"" she said. ""If you care about getting more people into the labor force, this is exactly where we need to focus our attention.""Still, supply chain issues driving inflation higher have been addressed and prices looked likely to continue to ease, she said.""The data that keeps coming out month after month shows that we continue to move forward. The evidence is not consistent with what a recession typically looks like,"" she said. ""The signs all point to ongoing recovery and robustness in the labor market."" US economyWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective.

"Bank IPOs performed worst, insurance best in 2022","Saturday January 07, 2023 The banking sector was in the news throughout 2022 with reports of loan disbursement irregularities and liquidity crisis, which elicited a negative reaction from the investors and resulted in a drop in two newly listed banks' share prices.Usually, there is a high demand for newly listed companies' shares in the secondary market of the stock exchanges, because investors make huge profits from new share transactions, but that was not the case for the newly listed banks last year.According to a report of the City Bank Capital Resources, the Union Bank Ltd and the Global Islami Bank Ltd were listed on the stock exchange in 2022. Investors did not show much interest in the banks' shares since the first day of trading of those shares. Consequently, those who got the shares through initial public offering (IPO) are currently suffering losses.However, investors made large profits by buying and selling shares of four insurance companies and three manufacturing sector companies that were listed in the stock market last year.Shakil Rizvi, shareholder director at the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), told The Business Standard, ""There was a huge impact of negative news regarding the banking sector throughout 2022, while the regulatory bodies remained silent about the veracity of those reports. These factors caused a negative reaction among the investors, and consequently affected the two newly listed banks' shares negatively.""He also said newly listed companies' share prices often jump, especially in the first few days of the start of trading, and then drop a few days later. This harms the investors as well as the stock market. So, it is not right to increase the share price sharply.New shares of 2022Last year, nine companies got listed in the DSE's secondary market, raising around Tk1,088 crore.Among them, the Union Bank raised Tk428 crore and the Global Islami Bank raised Tk425 crore respectively. These two banks had issued shares at Tk10 each.Out of the remaining seven companies, two – JMI Hospital Requisite and Navana Pharma – sold shares at premium prices fixed through the book building method.JMI Hospital Requisite issued shares at Tk20 each to general investors and at Tk25 to eligible investors to raise Tk75 crore from the stock market.Navana Pharma also raised Tk75 crore at Tk23.8 to general investors and at Tk34 to eligible investors.Besides, Chartered Life Insurance raised Tk15 crore, BD Thai Food Tk15 crore, Meghna Insurance Tk16 crore, Union Insurance Tk19.4 crore and Islami Commercial Insurance Tk20.30 crore. These companies issued shares at a face value of Tk10 each.The number of fundamentally strong companies should be increased in the stock market, said Shakil Rizvi. Worst performing IPOs of 2022For the year 2022, the Global Islami Bank's IPO performed the worst with a 10% negative return, which was followed by Union Bank with a 7% negative return.The Union Bank was listed with the Dhaka bourse in January last year with the biggest IPO among the listed banks, while the Global Islami Bank entered the market in November with the second highest IPO.The shares of these two banks are currently stuck at the floor price set by the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), so they cannot drop any further.These two banks were in the news last year for making several large loans breaking regulations. They also failed to maintain the capital reserve ratio (CRR) due to the liquidity crisis. So, the Bangladesh Bank has given special loans of Tk1,465 crore to the Union Bank and Tk700 crore to the Global Islami Bank, according to reports published in newspapers.Besides, the central bank has instructed the banks to send a daily log of sanctioned credit of Tk10 crore and above as it looks to restore order.Shahidul Islam, CEO of VIPB Asset Management, said investors have turned away from the shares of these two banks due to negative sentiment.Ershad Hossain, managing director and CEO of City Bank Capital, said the money market crisis is responsible for the decline in the share prices of these two banks. Best performing IPOs of 2022Chartered Life Insurance, which was listed in October 2022, was the top-performing IPO last year, with over 500% return since its listing.Following Chartered Life Insurance, BD Thai Food (400%), Meghna Insurance (328%), Union Insurance (273%), JMI Hospital (267%), Navana Pharma (226%) and Islami Commercial Insurance (181%) were the other top performers.VIPB Asset Management CEO Shahidul Islam said the IPO size of these companies is small, so their number of shares is low. As a result, these companies' share prices are increased through speculation, but in case of big IPOs, such speculations cannot be done easily.Shakil Rizvi, shareholder director at the DSE, said the IPO share price often increases by 400-500% in the first few days of their launching. After that, the share price drops again, which causes a high amount of losses for the general investors. This is a big reason behind the crisis in the secondary market. The regulatory body should pay close attention to this kind of sharp rise in prices.Prior to 2019, there was no circuit breaker for the first three days of trading of new company shares. That means, there was no limit to increase or decrease in share price for the first three days. When market manipulators increased share prices at an alarming rate by using this facility, the BSEC set a circuit breaker at 50% for the first two days in 2019. That means, in the first two days of launching a share, its price can increase or decrease a maximum of 50%.When the share price manipulation did not stop, the BSEC imposed a circuit breaker at 10% from the first day of trading of IPO shares in May 2021. As a result, it takes more time to manipulate IPO share transactions.IPO / insuranceWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective.

"World stocks soar, investors pare rate bets after US jobs data","Saturday January 07, 2023 Wall Street sparked a global rally in stocks on Friday after a crucial US jobs report showed wage growth slowed in December, fuelling investor bets that inflation is easing and that the Federal Reserve need not be as aggressive as some feared.Friday's data showed the US economy added jobs at a solid clip in December, pushing the unemployment rate back to a pre-pandemic low of 3.5% as the labor market stayed tight, while average hourly earnings rose 4.6% in December from a year earlier, down from 4.8% in November.Even though the data showed a still-robust labor market, investors read it as a sign that the US economy might be poised for a ""soft landing"" amid rising rates. A cooldown in wage inflation, an indicator the Fed also monitors when addressing price pressures, added to the optimism.Market cheer over the data helped the MSCI All-World index .MIWD00000PUS to leap 2.1%. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 .SPX jumped 2.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJIclimbed 2.1% and the Nasdaq Composite .IXICsurged 2.6%.Still, some analysts warned such exuberance might be misplaced since Friday's data argued that policy tightening was far from over.""Everything else about this shows a very, very resilient labor market which doesn't bode well for a smaller rate hike,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.""The odds have been relatively low that we would get a half a point (of rate hike) on 1 February, but those odds are going up every day based on all this data.""But investors paid no heed, especially after a separate report showed the US services industry activity contracted for the first time in more than 2-1/2 years in December.The currency market also dialed back expectations that the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points in February, and this pushed the dollar index =USD, which measures the greenback against six counterparts, down 1.2% to 103.90.US two-year Treasury yields US2YT=RR, which track interest rate expectations, dropped to 4.2640%, after spiking to a more than two-month high of 4.497% overnight. The 10-year yield US10YT=RR, which rose as high as 3.784% in New York on Thursday, also pulled back sharply to 3.5672%. US/The buoyancy on Wall Street spilled across the Atlantic, pushing Europe's broad Stoxx 600 equity index .STOXX up 1.2% higher. Germany's Xetra Dax .GDAXI also jumped 1.2%. Data on Friday had showed a sharp drop in eurozone inflation.A softer dollar boosted the euro EUR=EBS, which climbed 1.2% to $1.0644. The yen JPY=D3 also climbed against a weaker dollar, jumping 0.9% to 132.070 on the greenback. USD/Bullion also benefited from declines in the dollar, with the price of spot gold XAU= jumping 1.8% to $1,864.94 an ounce. The energy market appeared to be the only major asset class that bucked the buoyancy, with investors fretting over the prospect of a global recession crimping demand.Despite a sluggish dollar which tends to bolster the energy market, oil prices gave up earlier gains. Brent LCOc1 crude fell 0.2% to $78.57 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate CLc1 crude futures was largely flat at $73.77. O/RFriday's data showed the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, down from November's 263,000 pace, but above the 200,000 jobs forecast by economists, and still about double the level the Fed considers sustainable.""While the softening trend is clear, and the momentum of hiring is slowing in a significant way, it is equally clear that we are far from what could be described as a demand-reducing weakening of labor and wage conditions,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock.Fed policymakers also had a decidedly more sober take on Friday's data.Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expects the policy rate this year to get to the range just above 5.00%, and to stay there until ""well"" into 2024.That is a stark contrast to traders' expectations for the policy rate, now in the 4.25%-4.50% range, to top out at 4.75%-5.00% and then for the Fed to begin cutting borrowing costs in the second half of this year. World Stock / Wall St / US jobs dataWhile most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective.
