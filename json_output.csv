Donald Trump,Opinion | The Party of One Becomes the Party of None,"

The GOP is shrugging off its subservience to Trump, but with no one left to fill the void.

Opinion by Bill Scher

Link CopiedBill Scher is a contributing writer to Politico Magazine and a contributor to RealClearPolitics as well as co-host of “The DMZ,” an online show and podcast with conservative writer Matt Lewis.“This is not a Republican Party anymore. It’s a cult,” former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson said last year. He was far from alone. Ever since Donald Trump blustered his way through the 2016 Republican primary and general election — trampling over long-cherished conservative principles, viciously mocking any less-than-perfectly-loyal party members and boasting he could commit murder in broad daylight without losing supporters — the Cult of Trump image has sullied the Grand Old Party. Yet, in the speaker fight that consumed the House this past week, some Trump supporters put down their cups of Kool-Aid. The embattled Rep. Kevin McCarthy was endorsed by Trump, yet McCarthy’s loudest holdouts were Trump supporters. One of them, Rep. Lauren Boebert, audaciously and publicly admonished Trump on the House floor to “tell Kevin McCarthy that, ‘Sir, you do not have the votes and it’s time to withdraw.’” Rep. Matt Gaetz, on Fox News Thursday night, while professing his “love” for Trump, said the former president “is wrong to the extent that he supports Kevin McCarthy,” cheekily noting that “H.R. wasn’t always his strong suit.”Trump’s Wednesday endorsement failed to immediately flip any of the 20 Republicans who had previously rejected McCarthy (one additional Republican voted “present” soon after the endorsement). But that’s only the most recent exhortation from Trump that was ignored by congressional Republicans. Two weeks earlier, Trump instructed “every single Republican” to “vote no on the ludicrous, unacceptable $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill. It’s a disaster for our country, and it also happens to be a disaster for the Republican Party, because they could stop it.” Yet 18 Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, gave the package a filibuster-proof supermajority, smoothing its path to the president’s desk. (McCarthy and nearly all House Republicans opposed it, but McCarthy’s Republican critics claimed he didn’t fight it hard enough). in other words, Trump’s appeals have been ignored by both center-right senators and far-right House members.McConnell is a card-carrying member of the Republican establishment and has been shrugging off Trump’s criticisms of his bipartisan dealmaking over the last two years. Hard-liners like Boebert and Gaetz, on the other hand, have long been close to Trump substantively and stylistically. If they are no longer under Trump’s spell, then nobody in Congress is.And why should they be? Trump’s fearsome powers are no more. He had enough intra-party power in 2022 to engineer primary victories for most of his preferred candidates, and defeat several House Republicans who voted for impeachment. Yet he couldn’t dislodge the Republican governor and secretary of state of Georgia after (falsely) accusing them of abetting a rigged 2020 election. And his slate failed in the general election to win back the Senate for the GOP. Republican voters appeared to have noticed his diminished standing; over the course of the year, Trump lost significant ground to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2024 presidential primary polls.The end of Trump’s vise grip on the Republican Party should be a healthy development, except for one problem: Instead being a Party of One, they are presently a Party of None. No leaders. No shared principles. No consensus on policy objectives.A temporary period of leaderless soul-searching is not unusual or unhealthy for a party that lost a presidential election. Subsequent presidential primaries are a fine way to resolve internal debates, allowing the next standard bearer to chart the party’s course.However, America today doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for the Republican Party to get its act together. Voters just gave Republicans the keys to the House, and we need them — at minimum — to keep the government open, meet our debt obligations and avoid a global economic meltdown. Typically, these basic functions aren’t hard asks. But they may be too much for a Party of None to manage.While Trump may no longer be the heart of the GOP, his scar tissue remains. By constantly waging war on imperfectly loyal party members, Trump effectively repealed Ronald Reagan’s 11th Commandment, “Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.” By promoting a diplomatic thaw with Russia, Trump emboldened far-right neo-isolationists critical of the Ukrainian resistance, and threatened the year-long streak of bipartisan support for Ukraine aid. By recklessly instigating his own government shutdown as president, Trump whetted the appetite of Freedom Caucus members who appear eager to not only take the debt limit hostage but, for the first time, shoot it dead.All of these marks that Trump left on the Republican Party drove the resistance to McCarthy. Gaetz and Boebert suggested the protracted speaker fight was stopping the flow of funds to Ukraine. Rep. Ralph Norman said Wednesday he wants the next speaker to be “willing to shut the government down rather than raising the debt ceiling” (though the next day he partially walked the comment back and voted for McCarthy on Friday.).Most fundamentally, the right-wing dissidents — akin to the left-wing Occupy Wall Street protesters of 2011 — reject the basic concept of hierarchical leadership. Rep. Byron Donalds, who briefly ran against McCarthy, said individual House members should have the power to force floor votes that can fire a speaker, because he doesn’t want “more power into the hands of the speakership.” Boebert similarly told Fox News’ Sean Hannity, “We need a check and a balance on the third [sic] in line to the presidency.”Late into the night on Friday, McCarty finally flipped enough of the holdouts to win — not because of Trump’s endorsement, but because of a slew of concessions, including the rule change making it easier to oust the speaker. Gaetz boasted Thursday night that even if McCarthy managed to win, “he will have to live the entirety of his speakership in a straitjacket constructed by these rules that we’re working on now.” Just two years ago, House Republicans lived in fear of their party’s president. Today, they are building a House where the speaker must live in fear of his party’s members.Granted, the House Republican Conference has been unruly at times before Trump came along. Newt Gingrich’s speakership was wounded by an aborted 1997 coup attempt, hatched mainly by frustrated conservatives, before being put out of its misery after Republicans lost House seats in the 1998 midterm. In 2015, John Boehner, in defiance of Freedom Caucus demands, kept the government open mainly with Democratic votes. Then he quit before he could be fired.But today’s nihilistic Republicans, influenced by Trump’s limitless capacity for conflict, are going to historic lengths to strip the speaker position of power before the first bang of the gavel in the 118th Congress. What had been a cult is rapidly transforming into a state of anarchy.Of course, states of anarchy don’t last. Power fills voids. The Freedom Caucus is making enormous strides in filling that void. Even though McCarthy survived, as Gaetz noted, a set of rules and committee assignments was negotiated by the Republican factions that would allow the far-right far greater influence over what the House produces. The skewed proposals are unnerving some in the center-right. “I think they’re a mistake for the conference. These handful of folks want a weak speaker with a four-vote majority. The public will not like what they see of the GOP, I fear,” an unnamed House moderate told CNN.But reasonable Republicans were not obligated to be bystanders. They didn’t have to remain passive while the Freedom Caucus grabbed power from McCarthy. As GOP Rep. Don Bacon at times threatened to pursue, they could have sidelined the far right, forged a bipartisan coalition with Democrats and elected a speaker committed to raising the debt limit and keeping the government open.The partisan path Republicans took may seem the politically safer route, but can Republicans really rediscover their shared principles while the Freedom Caucus pressures the party to pursue politically dicey, scorched earth legislative tactics?House Republicans should look at the unity on the Democratic side of the aisle and consider how that materialized after a rocky two-year stretch. When Democrats were intent on passing party-line legislation through the filibuster-proof budget reconciliation process, they ended up in a protracted struggle with their most moderate members, one of which in the House (Oregon’s Kurt Schrader) was defeated in a primary and another in the Senate (Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema) became an independent. But in 2022 after Democrats passed a slew of bipartisan bills (and one party-line reconciliation bill, reduced in size by the moderate splinter faction), they were better positioned to run on a record of accomplishment, and against an extreme conservative agenda.The GOP couldn’t be a Party of One forever, and it won’t be a Party of None forever. Republicans will eventually find their way. But America needs them to find a way that doesn’t first drag us all through an obstacle course of dumpster fires. And they are not off to a promising start.Link Copied © 2023 POLITICO LLC",https://static.politico.com/cc/d4/42715cd047ed8687deb33593b233/20230106-gop-1-francis-1.jpg,,,"The GOP is shrugging off its subservience to Trump, but with no one left to fill the void.",[''],63ba9e4c15657e93626052ef
Donald Trump,Manhattan judge wants Trump to stop calling NY attorney general's $250 million fraud case a witch hunt,"A Manhattan judge on Friday delivered his latest blow to Donald Trump, rejecting what he called the former president's ""borderline frivolous"" request to dismiss New York's $250 million fraud lawsuit, which seeks to run his business empire out of the state.In a nine-page decision, New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron kept Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit on track for an early October trial.He stopped short of sanctioning Trump's lawyers, as he'd threatened earlier in the week, for filing what he called repeatedly rejected legal arguments — including the claim that James' three-year probe of his business and resulting lawsuit is a ""witch hunt."" As early as her 2018 campaign for attorney general, James, a Democrat, had made it clear she disagreed with the then-president's policies, and had promised to investigate and pursue fraud charges against his Manhattan-headquartered golf resort and real estate company, the Trump Organization.Trump's latest ""witch hunt'' argument — raised as part of a motion seeking the lawsuit's dismissal, is invalid, Engoron wrote Friday, because it has already failed before his court, in state appellate court, and before a federal judge last year, as the former president raised it again and again to fight the attorney general's investigatory subpoenas.In denying the motion to dismiss, Engoron rejected Trump's likewise repeatedly-rejected claims that James does not have the legal standing or capacity to sue him, and that the attorney general's allegations are too old to pursue.""Reading these arguments was, to quote the baseball sage Lawrence Peter (""Yogi"") Berra, 'Deja vu all over again,'"" the judge wrote.The judge also rejected as ""wholly unconvincing"" Trump's argument that disclaimers attached to the allegedly fraudulent financial statements sent to potential lenders — essentially warning them not to rely on his math — absolve the former president of fraud.Finally, the judge took a shot at Ivanka Trump, who has served as a Trump Organization vice president and who is named by James as a defendant, as are her brothers Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., both current vice presidents at their father's company.In rejecting Ivanka Trump's separately filed motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Engoron suggested she had been less than truthful in last year's court-mandated deposition before James' legal staff.Ivanka Trump had claimed she should be removed from the lawsuit because she had stopped working for her father's business in 2017 and was not accused of personally falsifying or knowing about the falsification of any company business records.The attorney general's evidence links Ivanka Trump to years' worth of interactions with her father's longtime favorite lender, Deutsche Bank, Engoron countered in his decision. Those interactions including overseeing the financing and subsequent loan compliance for the Trump National Doral golf course in Miami and the Old Post Office in Washington, DC.""The record establishes that Ms. Trump participated far more in securing the loans than just passively receiving emails,"" Engoron wrote.""In her deposition Ms. Trump testified that she does not understand statements of financial condition and that she does not even know if they would include all assets and liabilities,"" the judge wrote. ""This is despite her communications with Deutsche Bank about SFCs,"" he wrote.Ivanka Trump further claimed she couldn't be held legally liable in the attorney general's lawsuit, but that, too, is not the case, Engoron wrote.""The record demonstrates that Ms. Trump received over $10 million in profits from the sale of the Old Post Office,"" the judge wrote.If the request for proposal for the Old Post Office was based on fraudulent statements of Trump's worth, as the attorney general alleges, then the lawsuit could result in her having to forfeit some of those profits, he wrote.""Once again, Donald Trump's attempts to evade the law have been rejected,"" James said in a statement. ""We sued Mr. Trump because we found that he engaged in years of extensive financial fraud to enrich himself and cheat the system. Today's decision makes clear that Donald Trump is not above the law and must answer for his actions in court.""""We look forward to receiving a full and proper review of our arguments on appeal,"" said Trump attorney Alina Habba. Another Trump family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Donald Trump,How to Make Trump and the Wealthy Pay Their Taxes,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then View saved storiesTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved storiesBy John CassidySince a Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee released five years of Donald Trump’s tax returns, the Republicans’ farcical struggle to elect a new Speaker of the House has distracted attention from two urgent questions that the contents of the returns raised: How can we remodel the U.S. tax system to prevent Trump and other wealthy tax cheats from continuing to make a mockery of it? And, going beyond the individual case, egregious as it is, how can we use what we have learned to make the tax system fairer?After reviewing years of Trump’s returns and speaking with independent tax experts, I am convinced that there are three imperatives. First, we need to strengthen the Internal Revenue Service so that it has the capacity to hold accountable serial tax avoiders like Trump and to deter would-be imitators. Second, we must eliminate loopholes in the tax code that serve no economic purpose beyond sheltering the riches of the financial élite while depriving the federal government of much-needed revenue that would aid other Americans. (This shortfall amounts to upward of four hundred billion dollars a year, according to some estimates.) Third, we have to introduce broader changes to the tax code for an economic era where the rich accumulate vast amounts of untaxed wealth, and where inequality has reached record levels.Trump’s returns, which cover the tax years 2015 through 2020 and run to thousands of pages, have added new details to a story that is, by now, well known. For more than three decades, he has flaunted his wealth while paying very little federal income tax, and in many years no tax at all. In 2017, his first year in the White House, Trump and his wife Melania paid seven hundred and fifty dollars in federal income tax, far less than the average school teacher. In 2020, Trump’s last year in office, he and his wife paid no federal income tax.How did he manage this? One thing that kept down Trump’s tax liabilities was the fact that, while he’s a natural at self-promotion and marketing, he’s a bad businessman. The returns confirm that some of his companies, particularly his chain of upscale golf resorts, suffer hefty operating losses year after year, and this offsets income from his licensing deals and other more profitable enterprises. To cite a recent example: in 2020, two golf courses that Trump owns in Scotland reported respective losses of $9.6 million and $2.6 million.But poor management is only part of the story. Trump also takes hefty deductions for depreciation of his real-estate assets, a tactic that many other property developers also exploit. And he doesn’t stop there. The returns show him claiming dubious charitable deductions and reporting business expenses that, in some cases, are suspiciously similar to the revenues these businesses took in, raising the question of whether these were genuine business expenses. For example, in 2016, one Trump entity, DT Endeavor I LLC (an aviation company), reported gross income of $680,886 and expenses that also somehow totalled exactly $680,886—a coincidence noted by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in its report on the returns.Did the I.R.S. ask to see receipts for these expenses? We don’t know. We do know that, when the agency finally got around to auditing Trump’s returns in 2019, in all their length and complexity, it initially assigned the task to a single agent. We also know that, between 2010 and 2020, Congress reduced the I.R.S.’s budget by more than twenty per cent in inflation-adjusted terms, the number of people in the agency’s enforcement division fell by almost a third, and the rate at which rich taxpayers were audited dropped by more than two-thirds. “Rich, aggressive tax filers like Trump are playing an audit lottery, and they know they have little chance of getting caught,” Steven Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer who is now a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told me. “The U.S. tax system relies on filers providing good-faith estimates of their taxable income. When you have bad-faith actors, that puts more pressure on the system. The I.R.S. needs more technical support, more lawyers to litigate cases, and more agents who understand complicated tax returns.”As part of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, Congress took an important step toward reversing its past cuts, by allocating an additional eighty billion dollars to the I.R.S. About half of this sum will go to enforcement, particularly investigations of large corporations and high-net-worth individuals, like Trump. But House G.O.P. members, some of whom want to abolish the I.R.S. entirely, have already indicated their desire to rescind the additional funding. With Democrats controlling the Senate, that proposal has no chance of becoming law, but the threat from Republicans won’t end there. “When the debt ceiling comes up, they could hold up the entire country to reverse the eighty-billion-dollar increase,” Rosenthal warned.The first policy priority, then, is to insure that the additional resources for the I.R.S. remain in place, and that they get used wisely. But even a properly funded tax agency wouldn’t be able to prevent unscrupulous filers from exploiting every loophole in the tax code to the absolute maximum. Experts say the biggest reason that Trump has been able to avoid paying taxes for so long is three huge single-year losses, which he reported in the distant past: $916 million in 1995, nearly $700 million in 2009, and $200 million in 2010. Under the existing tax law, he has been able to carry these losses forward (and backward) to offset his tax liabilities in other, more profitable, years.Was this legitimate? At least in the earlier case, the I.R.S. appears to have accepted Trump’s huge loss carry-overs, or at least did not punish him. For the 2009 tax year and some subsequent ones, the agency audited Trump’s returns, and it’s not clear if these audits have been resolved. “Congress should investigate Trump’s huge operating losses and deductions,” Frank Clemente, the director of Americans for Tax Fairness, a Washington-based advocacy group, told me. “Is this something unique to Trump, or is this a loophole that others exploit, too, and which needs eliminating? Congress needs to find out. It shouldn’t be left to the I.R.S. to fight this out in court.”That brings us to the third imperative that I mentioned up top. If we want a better and more equitable tax system, we need to update the tax code for an economy that creates huge agglomerations of wealth, which a large industry of accountants and tax lawyers seeks to keep from the taxman’s grasp. Of course, progressive tax reform isn’t easy. If it were, abominations like the carried-interest deduction for managers of hedge funds and private-equity funds, which allows these people to shelter vast earnings, would have been expunged long ago. Still, there are a number of proposals already on the table that are worth pursuing, in whole or part.Reviving the effort to make wealth-fund managers pay their fair share would be a start. Another idea that shouldn’t be controversial is clamping down on the types of pass-through entities and private partnerships that feature prominently in Trump’s returns, and which can be used to avoid taxes and make it difficult for outsiders, including the I.R.S, to penetrate such financial thickets. The Democratic senator Ron Wyden has proposed draft legislation that limits the flexibility that these partnerships enjoy, and which would make it easier for the I.R.S to audit them effectively. That, surely, would be in the public interest.On a grander scale, President Biden last year proposed a “Billionaire Minimum Income Tax,” which would be tantamount to an annual wealth tax on some of the richest U.S. households. In addition to paying income tax on the income that they declare, households with a net worth of more than a hundred million dollars would be required to pay an annual levy on their unrealized capital gains. Although Biden’s proposal is less ambitious than the wealth-tax plans that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren unveiled during the 2020 Democratic Primary, its enactment would represent a landmark in U.S. tax policy.To be sure, with the Republicans controlling the House for the next two years, none of these proposals are likely to get far. But, in the spirit of trying to extract something positive from the Trump experience, it’s well worth developing them further and trying to build public support for them. And, while that’s happening, let’s not forget to strengthen the I.R.S. and protect it from renewed G.O.P. attacks. ♦A hookup app for the emotionally mature.A celebrity-divorce lawyer reflects on the state of marriage.Before my dad died, we went on vacation.A family heirloom from a university rec center.The repressive politics of emotional intelligence.Personal History by David Sedaris: after thirty years together, sleeping is the new having sex.Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.By The New YorkerBy Susan B.

Donald Trump,Judge Rules for Justice Dept. in Dispute With Trump Over Documents Search,"AdvertisementSupported byThe court said the former president had to provide the government the names of private investigators he hired to search his properties last year for any classified material still in his possession.Send any friend a storyAs a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share.By Alan FeuerA federal judge has ordered lawyers for former President Donald J. Trump to give the government the names of the private investigators who searched Mr. Trump’s properties late last year for any remaining classified documents, part of what appeared to be a step by the Justice Department toward questioning the investigators about their efforts, two people familiar with the matter said.The order, issued on Wednesday by Beryl A. Howell, the chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, was the latest twist in a monthslong dispute between prosecutors and Mr. Trump’s lawyers about how forthcoming the former president has been in returning classified material that he removed from the White House after he left office. Hundreds of classified documents were later recovered by the government from Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s private club and residence in Florida.The fact that the Justice Department sought a formal order for the investigators’ names suggests an increasing breakdown in trust between prosecutors investigating the documents case and Mr. Trump’s legal team. And the request comes as a special counsel has taken over the inquiry into whether Mr. Trump willfully retained sensitive records or obstructed the government’s efforts to retrieve them.The New York Times reported in October that a top Justice Department official had told Mr. Trump’s legal team that the department believed the former president still had classified documents in his possession even after the F.B.I. conducted a search of Mar-a-Lago in August and hauled away more than 20 boxes of materials, including about 100 documents marked as classified.Around Thanksgiving, the private investigators hired by Mr. Trump conducted their own round of searches and found at least two additional documents bearing classification markings in a storage unit paid for by the federal General Services Administration in West Palm Beach, Fla., not far from Mar-a-Lago.The documents discovered at the storage facility were promptly returned to the government. But in a display of their lack of trust and their anger, prosecutors asked Judge Howell in sealed filings to hold representatives of Mr. Trump’s post-presidential office in contempt for having failed to fully comply with an initial subpoena — issued in May — demanding that he return all classified documents he took with him from the White House.At a court hearing held behind closed doors last month, Judge Howell put off ruling on the government’s contempt request. The judge has still not issued a decision, according to the people familiar with the matter.The more recent spat began when prosecutors asked Mr. Trump’s lawyers for the names of the investigators who searched the storage facility and other Trump properties — among them, Mar-a-Lago; Mr. Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J.; and Trump Tower in New York.According to the people familiar with the matter, the lawyers offered to make the investigators available for questioning but wanted their identities shielded by a protective order, out of concern that the government might leak the information to the news media.Instead of agreeing to a protective order, one of the people said, prosecutors asked Judge Howell for a motion to compel the release of the investigators’ names. A spokesman for the office of Jack Smith, the special counsel who is overseeing the documents inquiry, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.If the private investigators are ultimately interviewed by prosecutors or are put in front of a federal grand jury in Washington that is investigating the handling of the documents, they will join a growing number of people close to Mr. Trump who have been questioned in connection with the case.Prosecutors have interviewed Walt Nauta, who worked in the White House as a military valet and cook when Mr. Trump was president and later for him personally at Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors have indicated they are skeptical of an initial account that Mr. Nauta gave about moving documents stored at Mar-a-Lago and have been using the specter of charges against him to persuade him to cooperate with the inquiry.Prosecutors have also conferred immunity on Kash Patel, a former close adviser to Mr. Trump, effectively forcing him to testify in the documents investigation in front of the grand jury. Mr. Patel had initially invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions from prosecutors investigating Mr. Trump.Advertisement",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/01/05/multimedia/05dc-documents-1-6902/05dc-documents-1-6902-facebookJumbo.jpg,2023-01-05T22:22:52.000Z,,The court said the former president had to provide the government the names of private investigators he hired to search his properties last year for any classified material still in his possession.,"['Classified Information', 'FBI', 'Justice Department', 'Mar-a-Lago', 'Trump Tower', 'Donald Trump', 'Jack Smith', 'Beryl Howell']",63ba9e5815657e93626052f3
Donald Trump,"Two years after US Capitol attack, investigation into Trump and insurrection enters new phase | CNN Politics","
      Two years after rioters stormed the US Capitol, the Justice Department’s sprawling criminal investigation into the effort to block the peaceful transition of power enters a new phase with the special counsel adding two right-hand prosecutors to an experienced team that will ultimately determine whether former President Donald Trump or his allies should face prosecution.  
  
      Special counsel Jack Smith has returned to the US after spending the past month working remotely in Europe while recovering from a bicycle accident.  
  
      He is adding two longtime associates who have specialized in public corruption cases, according to a person familiar with the matter: Raymond Hulser, the former chief of the DOJ’s public integrity section, and David Harbach, who conducted cases against former Sen. John Edwards and Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. 
  
      
      Newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith is moving fast on a pair of criminal investigations around Donald Trump
    
      The expansion under Smith shores up the office’s ability to examine broad conspiracy cases and determine the avenues of the investigation, another source said. They join a team of more than 20 prosecutors from DOJ, as well as senior advisers brought into the department in recent months, who were already investigating Trump and his allies.
  
      Despite Attorney General Merrick Garland’s assurances that Smith’s appointment won’t slow down the dual Trump-related probes, setting his office up does take time. Smith’s team is still working to find a permanent physical office location but has begun changing over email addresses for staffers who had previously been using their usual Justice Department accounts.   
  
      Harbach was seen by CNN getting his bearings in the federal courthouse in DC on Thursday, speaking to another special counsel prosecutor about extremist group cases and briefly sitting in on an ongoing Oath Keepers seditious conspiracy trial.
  
      According to the Justice Department, more than 950 defendants have been arrested for their alleged participation in the January 6, 2021, riot, with more than 500 being found guilty. Four people died in the attack, including rioter Ashli Babbitt who was shot by a Capitol police officer, two members of the crowd who suffered heart attacks, and one who died of an overdose. DOJ says 140 officers were injured that day and five officers died in the months after the riot – one of strokes and four by suicide.

      Smith and his new team have inherited the January 6 probe at a crucial juncture, as the public has a better understanding of the lengths the former president and his allies went to try to keep Trump in the Oval Office but also as congressional investigators hit the limits of their powers.   
  
      And where the House select committee hit brick walls in its probe – including with recalcitrant witnesses who claimed privileges, or, like Mark Meadows, bailed on cooperating with congressional investigators midway through – DOJ prosecutors now working under Smith will have certain tools to dismantle those barriers. They include ongoing legal proceedings about piercing the shield of confidentially that normally surrounds a president.                                                                                                                 
  
      The special counsel also has a massive amount of evidence already in-hand that it now needs to comb through, including evidence recently turned over by the House January 6 committee, subpoena documents provided by local officials in key states and discovery collected from lawyers for Trump allies late last year in a flurry of activity, at least some of which has not even been reviewed yet, according to sources familiar with the investigation. 
  
      Smith himself sent subpoenas to election officials in seven battleground states and received a trove of material. Included in the response from Michigan’s secretary of state is an email from a county official who was reporting two voicemails they received in December 2020 from individuals seeking access to voting equipment. One call came from someone claiming to work for Trump’s post-election legal team, the clerk wrote. 
  
      As Trump’s direct involvement in efforts to block the certification of the 2020 election becomes clearer, so too do the hurdles investigators may face if they try to build a case against the former president.     
  
      “They may get to the colonels, but they may not get to the general,” Michael Moore, a US attorney during the Obama administration, told CNN. 
  
      Witness emails, text messages and testimony from the House January 6 committee show Trump’s role in pushing alternate slates of electors, pressing battleground state officials to overturn the election results, attempting to replace the acting attorney general with someone who would embrace election fraud claims and laying the groundwork early on to call his followers to the Capitol.

      “POTUS expectations are to have something intimate at the ellipse, and call on everyone to march to the capitol,” rally organizer Katrina Pierson wrote in an email days before the Capitol attack.   
  
      But interview transcripts released by the committee also reveal gaps that could stymy federal investigators, witnesses with faltering memories and testimony about Trump’s tech-avoidance. 
  
      “My father doesn’t use text messaging or email,” Donald Trump Jr. told congressional investigators during his interview. As for other messaging apps, “I’m not sure he’d even know what they were,” Trump Jr. said.  
  
      Trump’s style of making ambiguous asks rather than direct demands was also on display as he pressed state officials to upend the election results. “One thing I do remember is that he never, ever, to the best of my recollection, ever made a specific ask,” said Michigan’s former Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey. “It was always just general topics.”  
  
      The committee’s investigation has given a fuller and more nuanced picture of the interconnected plots that the DOJ has been investigating, including a scheme to put forward slates of illegitimate Trump electors from battleground states that Biden won to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence and Congress to halt the certification of the results.  
  
      Campaign staff testified that Trump was behind the drive to carry out the maneuver, and the panel collected other evidence that Trump was in the loop about its operation – including with a phone call to RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.     
  
      According to the evidence collected by the committee, many of the state-based operatives and fraudulent electors themselves were largely in the dark about what the endgame of the gambit was. Several of them testified that they were under the impression alternate electors were being assembled as a contingency plan in case Trump prevailed in a legal challenge that changed the result in their state.    
  
      Meanwhile, top Trump campaign officials distanced themselves from the effort after the last prominent election challenge – a far-fetched petition at the Supreme Court – petered out on December 11, 2020.   
  
      For those who continued working on the scheme with Congress’ certification in mind, “DOJ would have a much easier case to prove,” said Ryan Goodman, a New York University School of Law professor and former Department of Defense general counsel.   
  
      The committee has assembled evidence that a group of Trump legal advisers – and namely, ex-Wisconsin state Judge Jim Troupis and lawyer Kenneth Chesebro – were looking at Congress’s certification as they put the fake electors plan in motion.    
  
      A memo outlining the plan on December 9 suggests those advisers saw the alternate electors crucial not only in the event of a court ruling that reversed Trump’s electoral loss, but if a “state legislature” or “Congress” deemed the Trump electors as the valid ones.   
  
      Trump and his allies could face additional criminal exposure, beyond the DOJ probe as prosecutors in Georgia are also investigating efforts to overturn the presidential election results there. The Atlanta-area district attorney leading that probe, Fani Willis, has labeled the individuals who served as pro-Trump electors from Georgia are “targets” in her investigation, along with some notable Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani. 
  
      While the committee made the historic move of referring Trump to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution, it also named several Trump allies as potential co-conspirators in its final report. One of them was former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.   
  
      “It was pretty obvious that the ex-president was the center of this conspiracy, but he was certainly assisted by many others, including … Mark Meadows and the like,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who served on the committee.   
  
      Meadows repeatedly comes up in the committee’s investigation, with evidence showing his involvement on some level in every gambit to overturn the election. Some of the most revelatory evidence came from Meadows himself – in the thousands of text messages he turned over to the committee before ceasing his cooperation with the investigation.   
  
      The texts show that beginning on Election Day, Meadows was connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories and strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6. Two days after the election, Trump Jr. was texting Meadows with ideas for keeping his father in power that he thought were “the most sophisticated” and “sounded plausible.”  
  
      Meadows and Giuliani, Trump’s one-time attorney, were involved in early conversations about putting forward fake slates of electors, according to testimony that former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson gave to the committee. 
  
      Transcripts released by the committee also reveal that Hutchinson testified before the committee how Meadows regularly burned documents in his fireplace around a dozen times – about once or twice a week – between December 2020 and mid-January 2021.   
  
      After producing the texts to congressional investigators, Meadows changed gears and did not show up for subpoenaed testimony before the House. A lawsuit he filed challenging the subpoena was unsuccessful, but the Justice Department opted not to bring criminal charges for his lack of cooperation. 
  
      The committee noted in their report’s summary that criminal prosecutors may have access to materials that lawmakers didn’t have, pointing to Meadows specifically.   
  
      “Indeed, both the Department of Justice and the Fulton County District Attorney may now have access to witness testimony and records that have been unavailable to the Committee, including testimony from President Trump’s Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and others who either asserted privileges or invoked their Fifth Amendment rights,” the summary said. 
  
      “When it comes to the President, he committed no crime so there should absolutely be no prosecutions related to him,” said Timothy Parlatore, one of Trump’s attorneys. 
  
      Parlatore insisted Trump and his team “were not looking to overturn the will of the people, only to ensure that the will of the people was accurately counted,” adding that Trump was “absolutely opposed” to the violence that took place at the US Capitol. 
  
      Meadows’ attorney declined to comment.

Donald Trump,"“He Was All In”: Donald Trump’s Influence Over Congress Remains A Force To Be Reckoned With, Even If Waning","To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories.By Kelly RissmanTwo years after former President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6 to stop the election certification of Joe Biden, Congress is still in chaos as his presence haunts the House chamber and continues to fracture the Republican party.Although a group of Republicans refused to back Trump’s pick for speaker, Kevin McCarthy, last night gave new life to the former president, thanking the former president even though he did not provide any additional votes for McCarthy. After McCarthy won the race for House Speaker—after four days and 15 rounds of voting—he gave credit to Trump: “But I do want to especially thank President Trump. I don’t think anybody should doubt his influence. He was with me from the beginning,” McCarthy told reporters after a dragged-out path to victory. “He was with me from the beginning — somebody wrote the doubt of whether he was there — and he was all in,” McCarthy added. “He would call me, and he would call others. And he really was — I was just talking to him tonight — helping get those final votes.”This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.The lack of unwavering loyalty to Trump’s pleas exemplifies Trump’s waning influence in the party, while McCarthy’s display of gratitude underscores the hold the former president still has on many Republicans in Congress. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said that Trump had spoken to her and other rebels “to tell us to knock this off."" Still, they did not relent. On Thursday, Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.), a McCarthy ally and former Secretary of the Interior for Trump, said Trump’s influence is “absolutely” waning.But the New York Times reported that Trump called Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.)—two of the “Never Kevins”—on Friday, likely encouraging them to switch their final votes from anti-McCarthy to “present,” which gave McCarthy the necessary votes to win.The former president was an outspoken advocate for McCarthy, often writing in support of him on Truth Social, Trump’s social platform.Earlier this week, Trump wrote: “Some really good conversations took place last night, and it’s now time for all of our GREAT Republican House Members to VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY…DO NOT TURN A GREAT TRIUMPH INTO A GIANT & EMBARRASSING DEFEAT. IT’S TIME TO CELEBRATE, YOU DESERVE IT. Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a GREAT JOB - JUST WATCH!”In a viral photo, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) was captured in the chamber holding up her phone, displaying the initials “DT,” ostensibly speaking to the former president shortly after McCarthy earned enough votes. By Joe PompeoBy Emily KirkpatrickBy Kenzie BryantThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Trump announced his White House run in November, though it’s unclear how much support he will have from Republicans, especially in the wake of the new session’s disarray.A Comprehensive Guide to Why a Ron DeSantis Presidency Would Be as Terrifying as a Trump OnePalace Insiders Say Prince William Is Already Furious About Prince Harry’s Memoir“No Willingness to Reconcile”: Prince Harry Wants His Brother and Father BackThe 45 TV Shows You Should Be Excited About in 2023The 26 Most Anticipated Movies of 2023Billy McFarland Is Sorry—Really.
