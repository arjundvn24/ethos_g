Andrew Tate,UK schools grappling with teens brainwashed by Andrew Tate: report,"Teachers in the United Kingdom are creating lesson plans to re-educate teenage students who have been brainwashed by misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate, according to a report.
Tate, who is locked up in a Romanian prison on charges of rape and sex trafficking, has had a toxic effect on teens who have embraced his hateful ideology, forcing teachers to address his views with their students, according to The Sunday Times.
A school in south London gave a presentation to a group of 14-year-olds after teachers became concerned about the students’ expressing ideas they learned from Tate, a self-described misogynist who has amassed a massive following of mostly young men on social media.
The group of about 30 students were reportedly asked questions like “Do we think he [Tate] is still harmless?” and “What happens when we take in his messages?”
The conversation quickly turned into a debate about rape, with about 10 of the students maintaining that women were responsible for their sexual assaults — a view propagated by Tate.
The male teacher then asked the students how they would feel if one of their family members was a rape victim.
“At that point a lot of the boys changed their tones when I put their mother or sister in that spot, but it was worrying that a few core kids didn’t and still said they would be to blame,” the teacher, who spoke anonymously, told The Times.
The 36-year-old former kickboxer and reality TV star is believed to be worth up to $100 million and has become hugely popular as a hyper-masculine life guru, posting online videos advising men to treat women like commodities.
He also brags about his wealth and shares his “secrets” of success — for a price.
In his videos widely shared on TikTok and other platforms, he claims that women belong in “the kitchen,” and should be controlled by men through violence.
Sophie Whitehead — who works at the School of Sexuality Education, which provides workshops on consent — called his rhetoric “violent” and said it has “affected so many young people.”
“It is a version of radicalization as far as I’m concerned,” said Sophie Whitehead, who works at the School of Sexuality Education, which provides workshops on consent.
In the south London classrooms, teachers have tried to explain to their students that misogynistic jokes and rhetoric can escalate to serious crimes like sexual harassment and rape, the outlet reported.

Jay Jordan, a teacher from Dundee in Scotland, told The Times the recent interest in Tate’s influence is evident among her students.
“You used to have to deal with sexist stuff but now it is explicitly connected to Andrew Tate – the boys do not stop talking about him,” she said.
Jordan recalled how after she rebuked one of her students, he shot back that she was “just a woman.”
“We’ve definitely gone backwards and it is worrying,” she said.
A female teacher at another British school told the newspaper that some students neglected to study for their final exams, saying ‘’I can get rich on the internet, that’s what Andrew Tate did.’”
The Ridgway Education Trust, which operates three state schools in Oxfordshire, has been teaching lessons about Tate’s rise to infamy.
“Every school should be addressing the Tate issue,” said Gohar Khan, director of ethos at the trust. “Up till last year I was wary about giving him airtime but pupils and staff have come to me and said, ‘Why are we not talking about this?'”
In the lessons, Khan said they discuss “why Tate has been in the news recently, for his arrest in Romania on charges of human trafficking and accusations of rape”.

“Our pupils are hearing all of this and I feel they need to hear it from what I think are reliable sources,” he added.
Tate’s first rise into the limelight came when he appeared as a contestant on the UK version of “Big Brother” in 2016.
He was booted from the show after a video emerged of him allegedly attacking a woman. Tate claimed the video was edited and “a total lie trying to make me look bad,” as reported by the BBC.
In 2017, during the height of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, Tate was kicked off Twitter for saying that women should “bear responsibility” for being sexually assaulted.
Tate’s popularity skyrocketed with outlandish comments about women’s intelligence, calling them “intrinsically lazy,” and is a strong proponent that men should have “authority” over a woman when in a relationship.
Last month, Tate and his brother, Tristan — along with two other men — were arrested in Romanian for allegedly running a criminal organization that lured in women and held them for sexual exploitation.
Romanian authorities raided his properties and discovered Tate and his brother had allegedly exploited six women who were kept as virtual prisoners in some of his luxury properties. He was ordered to be held for 30 days in Romanian prison on Dec. 30 while the investigation continues.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/tate-comp-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,2023-01-08 02:08:49+00:00,@nypost,"Teachers in the United Kingdom are creating lesson plans to re-educate teenage students who have been brainwashed by misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate, according to a report.

Andrew Tate,Andrew Tate admits women at house are NOT allowed to leave,"Andrew Tate admitted that women who stayed at his luxury villa were not allowed to leave and told them 'you don't go nowhere' in a now resurfaced video. Disgraced social media influencer Tate, 36, boasted in the YouTube video about his apparent playboy lifestyle, showing him flanked by young women in bikinis, getting onto private jets, and smoking cigars. And women working for him in Romania were allegedly branded with tattoos with the words 'owned by Tate'. Former kickboxer Tate, who has risen to notoriety in recent years for his attitude towards women, was arrested in Romania on December 29 in an investigation into alleged rape, human trafficking and organised crime. Andrew Tate (pictured) admitted that women who stayed at his luxury villa were not allowed to leave and told them 'you go nowhere' in a now resurfaced video Tate (centre), 36, boasted in the YouTube video about his apparent playboy lifestyle, showing him surrounded by young women in bikinis, getting onto private jets, and smoking cigars Tate claimed that women are 'stuck' at his house when they live there while he jets off internationally Police confirmed his location after he posted a bizarre video on Twitter - hitting back at Greta Thunberg for her 'small d*** energy' jibe - which showed a pizza box from a local restaurant. In the resurfaced clip Tate claims that women are 'stuck' at his house when they live there while he jets off internationally. Tate said: 'When you're a real G you're here, you're there, you're everywhere. You go to Warsaw, f***ing Dubai, Miami... I'm all over the place. 'With all these chicks just stuck in the house, sitting there bored, completely in love with me. 'And of course, they don't go out. They're not allowed out.' He said that women at his home were forbidden to go out to the club with their friends and chastised 'b***h a** dudes' who would 'let his chicks go the club without me'. 'No. You stay in the house. You don't go nowhere. No restaurants, no clubs, nothing,' Tate added. Police in Romania have been investigating former kickboxing champion Tate and brother Tristan since April last year. The probe began after a 22-year-old woman told police she was held against her will last year and culminated in officers raiding his villa last month and taking him and younger brother, Tristan, into custody. Andrew Tate is seen being escorted by police officers in Bucharest on December 29 after being arrested as part of a rape and human trafficking probe Women working for Tate, who pictured here on a boat in an image shared on social media, are alleged to have been tattooed with the words 'owned by Tate' Police sources told the Times that the woman and other alleged victims were tattooed with the words 'owned by Tate'. Authorities in Romania allege the 36-year-old kept six women under 'house arrest 24/7 like prisoners' at his compound. One judicial source previously told the Mail: 'The abuse was physical and emotional. They were not allowed to leave the house without security and they were watched day and night.' They added that the women were 'deprived of their freedom and followed everywhere'. It is claimed that Tate forced the women to create pornographic content against their will. He was arrested with his brother Tristan, and their assistants Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu in Bucharest on December 29 on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group. Officers from the city's anti-organised crime unit searched the property and took the quartet into custody. A day later a Romanian judge gave police permission to keep Andrew Tate in custody for 30 days while the investigation continues. Tate has denied all the allegations, with his representative Avocat Vidineac Eugen Constatin saying they would appeal the judge's decision. In a ruling released on Thursday, a judge said prosecutors had shown Tate has an 'attitude of disregard towards women in general, which he only perceives as a means of obtaining large profits in an easy way'. None of the four have been formally charged as of yet. Prosecutors allege that Tate recruited the women on social media platforms and lured them to Bucharest by falsely professing his love and intention to marry them. The tactics are known as the 'lover boy' method, which is used by criminals to recruit victims who are suffering from economic hardship by seducing them with gifts and promises of a better life abroad. The six victims were forced to take part in videos on the adult content platform Only Fans and the video-sharing app TikTok, with the two brothers allegedly pocketing all the proceeds. 'We have information – based on what they said on social media – that one of the girls brought in up to €50,000 (£44,350) a month,' the source said. 'They were given no money from what they earned.' The women include one American, one Moldovan and four Romanian nationals. Sebastian Vieru, who is a partner in some of Tate's other businesses, has denied the allegations  and said the sex business was 'perfectly legal' in Romania. 'When you have 100 girls of your own, you do not have to force any woman to do anything,' he said. It was recently revealed that Tate had previously been investigated by police in the UK over allegations of rape and throttling. Tate first came to prominence when he appeared on the TV show Big Brother in 2016, but was removed from the programme after a video surfaced online which appeared to show him attacking a woman with a belt – a clip he claimed had been edited. It is claimed that Tate (pictured on a private jet) forced the women to create pornographic content against their will Since then, he has gained further notoriety online for a string of comments about women, including suggesting that they 'bear some responsibility' if they are assaulted – an incident which led to him being banned from Twitter. In one video, Tate advised men accused of cheating by their girlfriends to 'bang out the machete, boom in her face and grip her by the neck. Shut up b***h.' Born in Chicago, Illinois, but brought up in Luton, Bedfordshire, Tate has also garnered a reputation over his various business activities. He operated a website called 'Hustler's University' in which members pay a monthly fee in order to receive instructions on dropshipping and cryptocurrency. Tate's followers earned commission for signing up new members, leading critics to label it a 'pyramid scheme'. The marketing programme closed this month. Together with his brother Tristan, he allegedly set up a webcam business in Romania in which young models told sob stories to unsuspecting male viewers. Despite telling the Sunday Mirror that the site was 'a total scam', Tate claims to have made millions from it. But it is his outspoken videos, popular with many young men, for which Tate is chiefly known. Clips on Instagram under the hashtag Andrew Tate have racked up more than 11.6billion views, and clips of on TikTok have been viewed more than 13billion times. In his goodbye message last year, Tate said the 'attacks' on him were 'disguised under the virtue of caring about women.' He added: 'None of these people attacking me care about women, none of them donate to women's charities, none of them donate to charity like I do, none of them help anyone like I do.' Tate said that he has a 'unique point of view' and that he welcomes people to challenge it, and that he has 'no problem with being disliked'. However, he said, he 'does have a problem' with people taking clips of his videos and reporting them 'out of context' and 'removing the tonality', and with people 'accusing him of illegality.' He claimed he became the 'most googled man on the planet' and that he was a 'victim of his own success' because it led people to want to find 'any little clip' that they could 'blow up' to be 'as controversial as possible' – because 'they want the views for themselves'.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/07/16/66301009-0-image-a-66_1673110461476.jpg,2023-01-07 18:45:24+00:00,https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail,"Video obtained by Gandul captures arrested Andrew Tate in the back of a police van in Romania.

Andrew Tate,"Influencer Andrew Tate’s arrest sparks conversations around misogyny, online hate  | Globalnews.ca","Andrew Tate, a divisive social media personality and former professional kickboxer, was detained in Romania in late December on charges of human trafficking and rape, according to local media reports.
Tate, a British-U.S. citizen who previously was banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech, was reportedly detained along with his brother Tristan in the Ilfov area north of Romania’s capital, Bucharest. His arrest has sparked important conversations surrounding public hate speech, social media’s influence on society, and the interactions between digital technology and gender violence.

Polarizing influencer Andrew Tate arrested in Romania on human trafficking charges

How Tate cultivated a popular platform for hate Moira Aikenhead is a limited-term assistant professor at the University of Victoria Faculty of Law and she specializes in technology-facilitated gender violence. Story continues below advertisement
Tate cultivated a big online following and Aikenhead says it is about more than just hate towards women. “He’s a self-described misogynist. Misogyny and degrading women is really central to who he is and his message,” she said. “However, it’s also sort of mixed in with other things. He’s also attempting to sell a lifestyle to people who feel disenfranchised or that the world has sort of wronged them. “Vulnerable, often very young men, I understand, make up a large segment of his audience.” Aikenhead says in a time where there is a lot of social disruption, extreme messages gain a lot of popularity. “People had a lot of strong responses to (the COVID-19 pandemic) and the government response to that,” she said. “We have a tanking economy. And this is really a situation where a lot of people are struggling right now. “Whether it’s extreme political views or misogyny or racism. People want to hear that there’s an easy solution to these issues or understand that there is a group that they can feel superior to or exert power over.” Story continues below advertisement
And in today’s society, it is easier than ever for people to become “influencers” on social media thanks to apps like TikTok. “If you look at it and the simplest form here is just your seven seconds of Tik Tok … and that person becomes an influencer, ” Jay Greenfeld, Winnipeg Clinical Psychologist, says. “As soon as these kids have access to this kind of stuff, they’re influenced by it in seconds. And then it just gets worse because that’s what their friends are doing. ” ‘Toxic’ masculinity in society and media Tate’s messaging centered on the idea that men need to be in their true rawest form, which he described as “alpha,” as he believes men have gotten too soft. Terms like “toxic” masculinity have gained more traction over the years. “What ends up becoming more of a challenge is men being caught in terms of the role they think they need to be playing and the role that they are playing and the role that they could potentially be playing,” says Greenfeld. “Men may have played a traditional role of the doer, the fixer, the individual who has to be accomplishing something … versus the supportive role, the softer role, the individual who can express more of their feelings as opposed to repressing them into more of a functional role.” Story continues below advertisement
Greenfeld says toxic masculinity comes from how people feel masculinity needs to be presented. “Believing they need to look a certain way. They need to behave a certain way. They need to eat a certain way. They need to only watch certain movies.”

And Aikenhead says Tate did a good job of exploiting that by selling a brand to men. “You can be rich and powerful like me if you follow my rules and the way that I view the world,” she says. “And also, hey, you are superior to women and the mainstream government, media, everything is trying to actively hold you down and make you not remember that you are more powerful than women.” Men need to accept that it is okay to struggle and to express those struggles and to be a support for others who may be struggling, Greenfeld says. “Instead of hiding all that, repressing all that, and then relying on either social media or various aspects of the internet to be their gateway when it might not actually represent how they feel and who they actually are,” Greenfeld said. Story continues below advertisement
“Men don’t need to be soft. Men need to be more of that alpha male. If that was the case, then things would have worked how they did 60 years ago.” Greenfeld says things have changed significantly for a reason. “So that there’s more equality and there’s a better understanding of how other people operate as opposed to, ‘I need to do it like this because that’s what my gender says.'” Dangers of hateful influence Tate’s criminal allegations have contributed to the conversation over the dangers of social media and its influence on society. “He’s not someone who is merely pandering to an audience. He’s clearly someone who is a misogynist, who does hate women. And that’s evidenced both by his message and by his actions,” Aikenhead says. “There is absolutely a potential for real-world violence as a result. And there are huge social consequences when these types of behaviors and viewpoints really escalate and gain more widespread popularity.” Aikenhead says there shouldn’t be any division drawn between what has gained popularity online and the real-world repercussions. “We know that a lot of people who engage in the sort of extreme online subgroups like the Incel movement can and have led to real-world deadly consequences in Canada and elsewhere.” Story continues below advertisement
Tate’s brand of misogyny is nothing new, according to Aikenhead. “Things that he can play off as jokes, like women should stay in the kitchen. But then interspersed with the actual telling of instances of violence and promoting real subjugation of women, ” Aikenhead says. “ So his message is not new. What is new is his ability to reach an absolutely massive, massive platform. And he was able to do so because there’s already this group of people who hold this level of extreme views, and they were just waiting for someone who was speaking to them.” Online content can be influential without consumers even recognizing it — its influence has only gotten larger over the last couple of years, Greenfeld says. “Things are being accessed for us. And then we’re being told what to watch, are being told what to see because it’s coming at us any time we turn on our computer.” What can be done about extreme online content? The social media algorithms are designed to promote the most extreme and the most divisive content, according to Aikenhead. “And Andrew Tate understood that very well and sort of asked his followers to create and share his more extreme viewpoints and divisive content,” she says. Story continues below advertisement
“Things that make people angry and get people talking and yelling at each other is what gets promoted. And at the same time, individuals get fed more and more extreme content, and they also see other people engaging with that.” Aikenhead believes the way to stop messaging like Tate’s is to regulate social media platforms and ensure the algorithms aren’t designed in a profit-maximizing way to promote what is getting clicks and engagement.

Calls for stronger internet regulations to protect kids online

“You cannot have algorithms that are completely free of any ethics and just promote the most extreme content to as many people as possible, “ she said. Meanwhile, Greenfeld says it is up to society as a whole to put a stop to this kind of messaging by refusing to entertain or engage with it. “So instead of sitting there saying, I can’t believe society is doing what it’s doing, I can’t believe we have access to what we have. And I can’t believe a guy like that would evolve into something like this,” he says. Story continues below advertisement
“You could also say, ‘wait a second, what can we do differently here so that people feel more in control of who they are and the choices that they’re making?’ “As soon as you start typing it online, your server is now hooked.” -With files from the Associated Press

Andrew Tate,Andrew Tate says women in his house aren't allowed to leave in chilling footage,"Controversial former kickboxer Tate rose to unprecedented fame as a result of his contentious views on society, and now footage has resurfaced of his attitude towards women Video Loading Video Unavailable Andrew Tate and his brother detained by Romanian Police Footage has resurfaced of Andrew Tate suggesting women in his house are not allowed to leave when in a relationship. Controversial ex-kickboxer Tate has risen to unprecedented fame in recent years which is largely down to his controversial views on women and society which have seen him go viral. During his time in the limelight, the 36-year-old has been banned from several social media platforms including YouTube, TikTok and Facebook, for reasons including his suggestion that women bear ""responsibility"" for sexual assault. Tate was arrested in Romania last month as part of a probe into alleged human trafficking, rape, and organised crime. And in a fresh clip which has come to light again since the arrest, Tate has been filmed bragging about his playboy-esque lifestyle while smoking a cigar with women either side of him in bikinis.

During the footage, as quoted by The Sun, Tate describes his life while the footage pans to him getting into a private jet before an image pans to him smoking a cigar. He then began speaking, claiming that women are ""stuck"" in his house while he travels around the world including to the UK where he was originally brought up in Luton. Tate then adds: ""And of course, they don't go out, they're not allowed out."" The chilling footage is then followed by Tate suggesting that women would not be allowed by himself to go clubbing with their friends, before he belittles a man who ""lets his woman"" go out without him in public. He continues: ""You stay in the house. You don't go anywhere. No restaurants, no clubs, nothing."" This is not the first time that controversial footage has emerged, when a video came to light of him allegedly beating a woman with a belt.

Tate was recently arrested in Romania

However the pair later came out and confirmed that their relationship was consensual, with the footage initially seeing him kicked off reality TV series Celebrity Big Brother. Tate has generated a fanbase of younger men who follow his 'Alpha Male' lifestyle guidance, which saw him launch a paid scheme called Hustlers University. Since Elon Musk took charge of Twitter, Tate has since had his account reinstalled and has already been embroiled in a high-profile feud with activist Greta Thunberg. Despite having put his fighting days behind him, Tate has also been linked with a number of high-profile boxing clashes including against YouTube brothers Logan and Jake Paul. Tate has already faced off with Jake, and a video went viral of the pair coming face-to-face but a fight has yet to materialise for Tate who hasn't fought since last year when he fought in two kickboxing clashes. His potential showdown with Logan was initially played down by his rival who claimed he would refuse to give the star a platform, but has since revised his offer to an MMA clash.",,2023-01-07 12:05:40+00:00,(Image: YouTube),"Controversial former kickboxer Tate rose to unprecedented fame as a result of his contentious views on society, and now footage has resurfaced of his attitude towards womenVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableAndrew...","['https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/andrew-tate-says-women-house-28897476', 'https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/andrew-tate-says-women-house-28897476.amp', 'https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvYW5kcmV3LXRhdGUtc2F5cy13b21lbi1ob3VzZS0yODg5NzQ3NtIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9ib3hpbmcvYW5kcmV3LXRhdGUtc2F5cy13b21lbi1ob3VzZS0yODg5NzQ3Ni5hbXA?oc=5']",63bad08a92dc4b7cc81acf6e

The news that Andrew Tate has been arrested on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and organised crime was met by many over-40s with a blank: “Who is Andrew Tate?” People learning about him for the first time can be shocked to discover he is one of the most famous men in the world.
If you spend your time reading mainstream publications and listening to or watching the BBC, you are likely to have been blissfully unaware of Tate’s existence. But if you spend your time on TikTok, or scrolling through YouTube shorts, you certainly do know who he is. As a member of the generic breed of “internet personality”, Tate’s fame rests less on his previous career as a kick-boxer or his appearance on Big Brother than on his outlandish and misogynistic statements on masculinity.
Tate has mastered the algorithm for short-form video content. He knows that transgressive content sells. He knows that being hated is just as important as being loved (and that the haters and fans fuel each other). Tate’s videos are slick, provocative, sometimes funny and always watchable. His father, Emory Tate, was a brilliant chess player, an American International Master. Andrew is brilliant at the game of internet fame.
Before he was kicked off the main social media platforms (he’s back on Twitter now, with 4.3 million followers), Tate had become a well-known figure, among younger men and boys especially. His videos racked up more than 12 billion views on TikTok. In a survey of 14,500 American teenagers conducted in August and September 2022, Tate was ranked the most important influencer followed by Emma Chamberlain, Kanye West, MrBeast, and Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. Tate was the third most-searched person online in 2022, after Queen Elizabeth II and Donald Trump.
To say that he has reactionary views about the role of men and women would be an understatement. In some of his videos, women are referred to as “bitches”. He believes that wives become the property of their husbands. Tate also plays into the idea that the world is being controlled by evil forces, using the analogy of The Matrix, a popular trope in the red-pill “manosphere” of online misogynists. After his arrest Tate tweeted simply: “The Matrix sent their agents.”

But the most important question about Tate is why he has acquired such a huge following. (As I write this, his Matrix agents tweet had one million likes.) Most of his audience is unlikely to buy into his most extreme comments, and the hard fact is that a lot of what he says is true and sensible, and not said often enough. Here is part of his message to young men, for example, as expressed to the Fox News host Tucker Carlson:  “I think that men’s issues are largely overlooked. The people in charge of the world pretend to care, but when somebody who’s championing men’s issues like myself comes forward and finally manages to garner huge percentiles of the public support I’m silenced. So they’re not really interested in men’s issues and there’s a lot of young men growing up today that feel very disaffected, they feel invisible. . . I basically just say to men: look, it’s a very hard life. You’re gonna need to get up, work hard, go to the gym… get yourself a strong network of brothers… Don’t tolerate men who just smoke drugs and play video games or men who are disloyal or dishonest.”

He’s not wrong. The failure of mainstream institutions, including governments, the media, philanthropy and academia to acknowledge and tackle the real problems facing many boys and men has created a vacuum in our politics and in our culture. This is a vacuum that populist politicians like Donald Trump can fill at the ballot box. And it is a vacuum that internet performers like Tate can fill online. It is tempting to simply de-platform men like Tate, and cut off the supply of this kind of content, but the deeper challenge is to reduce the demand. Millions of boys and men are desperate for help answering the question of what it means to be a good man today. If we don’t like Tate’s answer, we need a better one ourselves.

Andrew Tate,Andrew Tate’s mom is reportedly ‘not happy’ with son’s actions,"Andrew Tate’s mother does not like the kind of things he says. According to The Sun, Eileen Tate, who is still believed to live in the notorious Luton council estate where she raised her children, has spoken out about her Tate’s actions. A family friend told MailOnline that she “doesn't like what's going on.” The friend added, “I don’t think she is happy with what Andrew says, the misogyny. She says he says these things for the response he gets – for the number of hits on the internet.” They continued, “He’s always going on about fast cars and what a man should be, but Eileen didn’t raise him like that.” Moreover, a relative of Tate’s late father claimed that ‘he would be ashamed of his sons’ actions,’ via The Sun. Andrew, 36, and his younger brother Tristan, 34, are suspected of having recruited victims for a criminal online porn scam. He arrested with his brother, and their assistants Georgiana Naghel and Luana Radu in Bucharest on December 29, 2022, on suspicion of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group. Officers from the city's anti-organised crime unit searched the property and took the quartet into custody, per Daily Mail.",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2023-01-08/463671_114020_updates.jpg,,@Web Desk,"Andrew Tate’s mother does not like the kind of things he says.According to The Sun, Eileen Tate, who is still believed to live in the notorious Luton council estate where she raised her children, has spoken...","['https://www.geo.tv/latest/463671-andrew-tates-mom-is-reportedly-not-happy-with-sons-actions', 'https://www.geo.tv/amp/463671-andrew-tates-mom-is-reportedly-not-happy-with-sons-actions', 'https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvNDYzNjcxLWFuZHJldy10YXRlcy1tb20taXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1ub3QtaGFwcHktd2l0aC1zb25zLWFjdGlvbnPSAVhodHRwczovL3d3dy5nZW8udHYvYW1wLzQ2MzY3MS1hbmRyZXctdGF0ZXMtbW9tLWlzLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktbm90LWhhcHB5LXdpdGgtc29ucy1hY3Rpb25z?oc=5']",63bad08c92dc4b7cc81acf70
Andrew Tate,Rebecca Black Had The Perfect Tweet About Andrew Tate’s Cringey Song,"In 2021, Rebecca Black celebrated the 10-year anniversary of “Friday” with a bad-ass remix featuring Dorian Electra and Big Freedia. She suffered lots of trolls at the time in 2011, but her comeback has been big and rejuvenating.
Today, January 6, she took to Twitter to react to a viral clip of Andrew Tate’s unlistenable song “Sugar Daddy” and its embarrassing music video. She quote-tweeted the clip with a simple statement: “i was 13 this man is 36,” in reference to the fact that she was just a kid when her song gained online infamy while Tate’s cringe-worthy output is less excusable. Of course this diss immediately went viral, and some are pointing out that “Friday” is actually not a bad song. This follows the recent arrest of Tate as part of a sex trafficking investigation, which happened after he was dissed by Greta Thunberg.
About coming out as queer, Black told Uproxx, “Gosh, it’s been a really intense year and a half for all of us. I feel now, especially in hindsight, just really fortunate to have been able to take the time to really focus on what was important for me to prioritize in my life and in my world. Coming out definitely had a lot to do with the direction that my project has taken. I feel really good and proud of the progress that I’ve made.”",https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Rebecca-Black.jpg?w=640,2023-01-06 15:25:13+00:00,@UPROXX,"In 2021, Rebecca Black celebrated the 10-year anniversary of “Friday” with a bad-ass remix featuring Dorian Electra and Big Freedia.

Andrew Tate,What turned the son of a chess champion into world's most toxic man?,"Amid the fripperies on show at Andrew Tate's palatial Romanian mountainside villa, a humble chess board is a stark reminder of the past he has left behind. By his own admission, the carved set is a nod to the toxic influencer's late father, an International Chess Master and former U.S. Air Force sergeant who died in 2015. Heaven knows what that brilliant man, who learned to speak fluent Russian while working in Cold War-era Berlin, would have made of his louche eldest son — arguably both the most loathed and yet, paradoxically, the most popular man on the internet, thanks to his unique brand of misogyny. Tate, 36, who was raised by his British mother on a council estate in Bedfordshire, has been locked up in a Bucharest prison cell ever since an armed raid on his secret bolthole on the outskirts of Bucharest on December 29. Amid the fripperies on show at Andrew Tate's palatial Romanian mountainside villa, a humble chess board is a stark reminder of the past he has left behind He and his younger brother Tristan, 34, are accused of being part of a human trafficking ring which used violence and psychological pressure to force at least six women to perform in sexually explicit videos which were then sold online. According to Romanian authorities, the pair will be held in custody until the end of January while police continue their investigations. Back in the UK, two women this week also came forward to accuse Tate of raping and violently abusing them. This stems from a case in 2015 when Tate was arrested for rape and sexual assault while running a webcam sex business out of a dingy flat in Luton. While Tate denies these allegations, what is not contested is the vile poison that the former kickboxer has been spewing against women via social media platforms, notching up millions of internet followers, not to mention an estimated £100 million fortune, in the process. Much of that money has been made via his online 'Hustler's University' which, for around £40 a month, offers to help students become as rich as Tate and to 'free modern man from socially induced incarceration'. The real mystery lies behind the creation of this 'king of toxic masculinity'. What could possibly have gone so awry in his past relationships with women, or his upbringing, to create the kind of man who believes that women should 'bear responsibility' when men sexually assault them? By his own admission, the carved chess set is a nod to the toxic influencer's late father, an International Chess Master and former U.S. Air Force sergeant who died in 2015. Pictured: Young Tate with his father and siblings An investigation by the Mail this week has uncovered Tate as a complex character, with a highly formative past. For while on the one hand he is descended from a great-great grandmother freed from slavery at the end of the American Civil War, he is, according to relatives, essentially, a 'Mummy's boy' whose family is torn between bemusement and pride at how he's turned out. On the rundown 1970s Luton housing estate where his mother, Eileen, a former school kitchen assistant, still lives, a family friend said: 'Their mum is proud of Andrew and Tristan, of course she is. Eileen loves her boys. 'Most probably she doesn't like what's going on. What they've been accused of is very serious. I don't think she is happy with what Andrew says, the misogyny. 'She says he says these things for the response he gets — for the number of hits on the internet. 'He's always going on about fast cars and what a man should be, but Eileen didn't raise him like that. If you say anything to her about it, she'll say, 'That's my boys.' ' Indeed, Eileen is said to have been a frequent visitor to her sons' Romanian hideway, prior to their arrests. According to the friend, Tate's online persona is nothing like the young man who studied at the town's Halyard High School, and Luton Sixth Form College, before leaving to become a solar panel salesman. 'He was not the big 'I am,' ' remembers the friend. 'None of us would have seen any of this coming. His mum was a kitchen assistant in a school when the children were growing up. She gave them the basics. 'What he's saying on social media, that women should stay at home, that all this money makes you a man, is so outdated. 'I think the whole family is gobsmacked by what's happened. They don't know how he's become this big social media star. The family don't like to think the worst of him.' Tate is, according to relatives, essentially, a 'Mummy's boy' whose family is torn between bemusement and pride at how he's turned out. Pictured: Tate with mother and siblings Eileen herself was not at home this week. The family friend said she was in the U.S., visiting her daughter. Tate has previously admitted that his sister Janine, a lawyer living in Lexington, Kentucky, is a 'feminist' and doesn't speak to him or his brother. Eileen met the boys' American father, Emory Tate Junior, in the mid 1980s, at a Ministry of Defence base, Chicksands in Bedfordshire, which was being used by the U.S. Air Force at the time. The couple married and moved to Chicago, where their first son was born. They named him Emory Andrew Tate III, after his father and grandfather, a trailblazing lawyer who was rejected by Harvard Law School but got into university on the back of his service record as a GI during World War II. Later, the family moved to Berlin where Emory Tate, known as Dennis to his family, served with the 6912th Electronic Security Group at Tegel Airport. A talented linguist, he learnt Russian for intelligence purposes. He was also U.S. Armed Forces chess champion five times in the 1980s, a record which has still never been beaten. By the mid 1990s, Emory Tate's name was known throughout the global chess community. But while he taught his children the game — Andrew Tate himself has said that he became a chess champion aged five, after beating a 15-year-old in an under-16 competition in the U.S. state of Indiana — he was frequently absent from home, playing hundreds of games in the US and Europe. He and Eileen divorced in 1997 and she moved with her children back to her hometown, and raised them single-handedly on the Marsh Farm estate, where she still lives. They remained in close contact with their father, right up until his death in the middle of a game at a tournament near San Jose in California in October 2015. An investigation by the Mail this week has uncovered Tate as a complex character, with a highly formative past But this week, Emory Tate's 65-year-old American cousin, Melvin Cox, told the Mail that the boys' father 'wouldn't have signed off on any of the things they are saying'. Speaking from his home in Montgomery, Alabama, he said: 'As far as I'm concerned their dad would have respected their business acumen but he wasn't into misogyny or anything like that. He was a nice guy and a hell of a chess player. 'Their father had nothing to do with what they were doing. He was never involved in anything they were doing over there, so anything they have created and built up, and the names they have made for themselves, is all about them. 'Their dad was a totally separate person. He had a wife and kids, he had a military career and he had chess. That was his life. As far as what they have accomplished, I don't know if their father would be proud of any announcements they've made from their soapbox.' Describing the two brothers as 'provocateurs and agents of chaos', he added: 'What I always thought about the two boys is that they were just in it for the money. 'I choose to think that their most outrageous statements are not something they believe in but something they say to get more clicks and more money. I like to think it's not what makes them tick — it's just business. 'They're not the only ones. People are sheep — but nobody blames the audience.' By the time Tate and his identical-looking brother were in their early teens they were professional kickboxers. But they were hungry for fame and believed the best way to find it was via reality TV. Tristan Tate appeared on Channel 4's 'castaway' show Shipwrecked in 2011 alongside serial reality TV star Stephen Bear, another loathsome character who was convicted of sex crimes at Chelmsford Crown Court last month. A 21-year-old Andrew, meanwhile, appeared on the Channel 4 show Ultimate Traveller, in 2010, but did little to distinguish himself from his fellow contestants as they competed for a £10,000 prize by backpacking around Indonesia on a shoestring. He was forced to leave the show early after developing an eye ulcer, but not before he'd declared for the cameras: 'I've never been in a situation in my 21 years of life where I really wanted something and didn't get it. My plan is to lie and cheat my way through this competition.' His next TV appearance was on Channel 5's Big Brother in 2016 but he was kicked off after a video emerged showing him beating his ex-girlfriend with a belt. At the time he claimed that they were taking part in consensual role play. But according to reports this week, the real reason for his expulsion was that producers were contacted by Hertfordshire Police and told about their ongoing sexual assault investigation, concerning two women working in the webcam business in Luton. Even so, it took five days to remove him, during which time he was seen playing truth or dare in the hot tub and kissing one of the female contestants. Officers took four years to pass their investigation to the CPS, who ultimately declined to prosecute Tate. This week, Hertfordshire Police acknowledged that there were 'some delays to the investigation', adding: 'This was addressed at the time and apologies were made.' The CPS said that it 'carefully reviewed the evidence' but concluded that it 'did not meet our legal test' — despite the fact that one of the women was witness to the other's rape. Disturbingly, however, the women's claims of abuse, while being paid £15-an-hour to work for Tate's webcam sex business, are the same as the claims for which Tate is now being investigated. 'His mum's not happy with what he says, the misogyny' Romanian authorities are probing allegations that Tate and his brother lured women to their £600,000 complex using what is known as the 'loverboy method', falsely claiming to be in love with impressionable young women and using emotional and physical control to force them to take part in porn videos. One of the women, calling herself Sally, claimed in Vice World News that she was strangled by Tate on at least five occasions and saw him choke other women on at least ten occasions. She said she and another girl would wake up with marks around their eyes caused by burst blood vessels. Tate has boasted openly about the 'loverboy' approach on since-deleted sections of his website. His online course the 'Pimpin' Hoes Degree' instructed men how to recruit women for webcam work using manipulation. 'My job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, test if she's quality. Get her to fall in love with me to where she'd do anything I say, and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together.' It's 'instructional' videos like these that educationists have warned are fuelling vile sexism and misogyny, disguised as male 'self-help' among a generation of impressionable teenage boys. For while British parents are unlikely to have heard of Tate until the dramatic events of the past week, millions of youngsters have become obsessed with his monied lifestyle, which is regularly paraded via online images of the man himself, clad in designer clothes, travelling on board private jets or in million-pound sports cars, accompanied by beautiful women and bundles of cash. His message is as simple as it is dangerous: if men follow his example, they too can have his life. His move to Romania, he admitted, was partly to escape liberal Western society, where sexual assault claims against men were taken more seriously. 'In eastern Europe, none of this garbage flies,' he said in one video clip. 'If you go to the police and say 'He raped me back in 1988', they'll say 'Well you should have done something about it then.' ' The last time Melvin Cox saw his cousin's sons was in October 2015, at Emory Tate's funeral which, he says, was a 'celebration' of his life. Afterwards, Andrew Tate, then still focused on his career as a kick boxer, said: 'My dad taught me everything. Absolutely everything. And my fighting style in the ring mimics his on the board.' He once described his father as 'a man who was at home in his own skin. He didn't need or want a car or a little garden to feel at home. He was happy anywhere . . . he didn't have a lot of material possessions but he was a genius. Make no mistake — not only in chess, at everything.' The life he has chosen for himself couldn't be more different.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/01/06/21/66283699-0-image-a-19_1673039572529.jpg,2023-01-07 00:15:42+00:00,https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail,"Video obtained by Gandul captures arrested Andrew Tate in the back of a police van in Romania.

Transcripts from the Tate brothers file. The two allegedly forced their victims to tattoo their names
by Romanian news site Digi24.ro
Translated by Google Translate:
New information is emerging from the case in which millionaire brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate were arrested for human trafficking. The two influencers would have forced their victims to tattoo themselves with their names, and the security employees would have always stood with guns in sight, to intimidate the women. In transcripts, Andrew Tate tells how he used women to launder money. The news about the arrest of the Tate brothers also reached Afghanistan. The Taliban are demanding their release because Andrew converted to Islam in 2021.
The Tate brothers’ victims told prosecutors that when they first arrived at the suspects’ villa, they were met by armed guards. Their role was to put pressure on the women so that they never took a break from the work they were doing on the adult sites.
Prosecutors have obtained wiretaps in which Andrew Tate recounts how he broke the law and used women.
Andrew Tate: You’re not stupid and you can probably guess how I make so much money. I have to hide what I’m really doing.
Victim: Web cam?
Andrew Tate: For a long time I did this with a team of girls working on video chat. The company was fake, but this is how I laundered my dirty money. Some of the girls who worked for me (…) I used them to do other things. To move money or illegal things, documents, etc. I will never do that with you.
The humiliation of the victims did not stop there. Investigators have obtained shocking statements from women who were allegedly recruited by the Tate brothers. They told that they were forced to get tattoos with the message “owned by Tate”, i.e. Tate’s property. The Tate brothers’ lawyer says, however, that the women got the tattoos on their own initiative.
Ioan Gliga – the lawyer of the Tate brothers: I would understand this gesture made by the respective persons as a gesture intended to make themselves as pleasant as possible by the Tate brothers and at no time was the question of conditioning or coercion raised to make such a gesture and it was their free will.
Gabriela Groza – forensic psychologist: Human traffickers are people who have more pronounced psychopathic traits. They don’t feel remorse, they don’t feel regret, they either blame the victims, disregard them, or place the responsibility elsewhere.
Andrew Tate has become one of the most famous people on the Internet. Before he was arrested, he was doing the rounds of shows and podcasts, and often talked about how satisfied he is with the corruption in Romania. The Tate brothers’ attorney says all DIICOT allegations are false and that the victims allegedly produced pornographic material to make money for them.

Andrew Tate was also investigated in the UK for rape in 2015, but charges were dropped.
Per, The Guardian, “A damning official examination into how police forces tackle rape has exposed persistent failings in the criminal justice system, including a failure to track repeat suspects, “explicit victim-blaming” and botched investigations.”
